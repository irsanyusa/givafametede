The competition is really heating up, as contestants continue to improve. Tonight’s show even featured the <a href=#>first 10 of the season</a>!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-dancing-with-the-stars-couples-were-eliminated-on-disney-villains-night>Which ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Couples Were Eliminated on Disney Villains Night?</h2><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>None of the couples were eliminated on Monday night, so Tuesday’s episode featured a double elimination. Voting was open during the show. Scores and votes from both nights were combined to determine which two couples were sent home.</p><p>At the end of the night, host Tyra Banks announced the Bottom Three couples. They were&nbsp;Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess, Matt James and Lindsay Arnold, and Kenya Moore and Brandon Armstrong. Brian and Sharna were automatically eliminated based on the scores and votes.</p><p>Brian and Sharna were at the bottom of the leaderboard this week, with a combined score of 52. They were also the only couple who didn’t break a score of 30 during tonight’s episode. So it’s not exactly a surprise that they were eliminated.</p><p>The judges were then able to save one couple from the Bottom Two to move on to next week’s show. Because the judges were divided, the choice ultimately came down to Len Goodman. He chose to save Kenya and Brandon, meaning Matt and Lindsay were eliminated.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-iman-shumpert-wows-everyone-with-crazy-lifts-during-tango>Iman Shumpert Wows Everyone with Crazy Lifts During Tango</h3><p>Iman Shumpert and his partner Daniella Karagach <a href=#>really stepped up their game</a> during Tuesday’s Disney Villains Night. They danced the Argentine Tango to “Arabian Nights” from Aladdin, with Iman playing Jafar and Daniella playing his parrot Iago.</p><p>They took that assignment very literally, as Iman lifted Daniella up as if she were as light as a feather. He actually held her over his head as they descended the stairs at the start of the performance. Then at the end, she perched on his shoulder like an actual bird.</p><p>The Dancing with the Stars judges were stunned by the routine, with Derek Hough calling it “iconic,” and Carrie Ann Inaba saying it was “poetry in motion.” The couple earned their highest score of the season with 33, putting their combined score from both nights at 63. With more moves like that, Iman could be the dark horse of Season 30.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1-btRaatO8</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-melora-hardin-dominates-the-leaderboard-once-again>Melora Hardin Dominates the Leaderboard Once Again</h3><p>On Monday, Melora Hardin and her partner Artem Chigvintsev topped the leaderboard with an incredible Foxtrot, and they continued to dominate the competition on Tuesday, scoring the first 10 of the season with their Jazz routine to “Mother Knows Best” from Tangled.</p><p>Melora played the villainous Mother Gothel, and she even recorded the song they danced to! It’s becoming clear that Melora is committed to this competition, and she’s willing to go above and beyond to deliver the best performance. The couple scored a 37 from the judges, giving them a combined total of 73 for both nights.</p><p>If you can believe it, the first 10 of the season actually came from judge Len Goodman. This just has us even more excited to watch how contestants like Melora continue to improve from week to week.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>MELORA HARDIN CONTINUES TO DOMINATE DISNEY NIGHT WITH FIRST 10 OF ‘DWTS’ SEASON 30</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-competition-is-heating-up-on-dancing-with-the-stars-season-30>The Competition Is Heating Up on ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Season 30</h3><p>Other highlights from Dancing with the Stars Villains Night included Jimmie Allen and Emma Slater’s Jazz routine to “Bad Guy” as Captain Hook and Tinkerbell. Goodman said Jimmie keeps surprising him and transforming, and Bruno Tonioli called it his best performance yet.</p><p>Melanie C and Gleb Savchenko also impressed with their Viennese Waltz to “Once Upon a Dream,” with Melanie playing Maleficent. They scored their first 9s of the season, with Carrie Ann Inaba calling it their “best dance by far.”</p><p>Amanda Kloots and Alan Bersten also wowed with a Cruella-themed Paso Doble, which Inaba called “powerful and masterful and so divine.” They earned a score of 36, the second-highest of the night. Amanda continues to be a frontrunner in this season’s competition.</p><p>Host <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a> announced that next week’s show will be a tribute to Grease.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1255096952.jpg alt="Tyga Stays Quiet After Arrest for Alleged Domestic Violence Incident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlnKGenHq4tdOhZK2glWLAta3RrGSrnZOWvW6wyKylnrFdq7atuMCipaxlnp60qcCMnqWdq12eu26wzq6ZpZ1dmrmqucinmK2hn6N8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./home-economist-clean-queen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Home Economist: Clean Queen | TIME</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aly-raisman-body-confidence-sexual-assault-periods.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aly Raisman Talks Body Confidence, Sexual Assault, Periods</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
