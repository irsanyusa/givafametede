You know if you took the shortcut, the easy way out or cheated. No one else does. I know that I look back with regret on some things that seemed to be success to others.</li><li>Essentially, I was always more of a practice coach than a game coach. This is because of my conviction that a player who practices well, plays well.</li><li>I'm not a believer in meetings or so-called chalk talks or blackboard drills. I believe in learning by repetition to the point that everything becomes automatic.</li><li>One of my constant reminders was, "End practice on a happy note." I wanted the boys to want to come out to practice, and I wanted them to get a certain amount of pleasure out of basketball. It's a game. It should be fun.</li><li>I think the coach's job is to prepare players to play and then let them do it. Failure to prepare is preparing to fail. And the preparation process has to take place before the game, with any needed adjustments made during time-out and at half time.</li><li>You must set an example. Your players must know that you care for them more than just as athletes.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e7212f8b1b696e29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viktor Frankl quotes from Man's Search for Meaning</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f2f70f7e32c61924.jpg><h2>John Wooden books</h2><p class=align-left>Some of the most famous Coach John Wooden quotes are obtained from his books.
