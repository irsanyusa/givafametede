The head-scarf issue in Turkey is not in any way similar to the issue in Europe. In Turkey, if Islamic symbols are allowed in public places, the voice of people who believe in other religions would not be heard. Moreover, one practice the Justice and Development Party (AKP) has been following consistently is separatism. The AKP continually distinguishes the “religious” from the secularists, who its members imply cannot be good Muslims. Who are they to decide who is religious and who is not? Religion should stay in the private sphere to ensure religious freedoms for all.<br>Esra Music, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Raid in the Name of Allah</strong><br>Aryn Baker’s “Among the believers” was amazing and the most human account of the radical Islamic students’ standoff at the Red Mosque in Islamabad that I have read so far [July 16]. I was truly amazed by the correspondent’s unshakable ability to stay objective and present a clear picture of those who are completely devoted to their faith. I was raised as a Lutheran, a faith that was once perceived as a radical reformist movement with fanatic followers. I was very moved by Baker’s story.<br>Peteris Timofejevs-Henriksson, BRUSSELS</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pakistan’s President General Pervez Musharraf’s handling of the Red Mosque crisis was designed to please the West. He will receive an enormous backlash. There are many other ways to engage Islamic extremists. If the West hopes to win the hearts and minds of Muslims, it must learn to respect our values and treat us with dignity. This marks the beginning of the end for Musharraf.<br>Said Bala Shuaib, LAGOS, NIGERIA</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Dynamic Duo?</strong><br>Thanks for a balanced look at new York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, warts and all [July 23]. Both are in their seventh decade, yet their approach to politics is progressive and refreshing. No conservative clichés and smoke-screen social issues; just good old-fashioned compromise and common sense. Isn’t that what governing is all about?<br>Bob August, REPUBLICANS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, NASHVILLE</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bloomberg and Schwarzenegger are successful because they serve constituents rather than political interests. They don’t govern with a my-way-or-the-highway approach but are willing to reach across the aisle, admit mistakes and change directions. While they don’t appear concerned with their legacies, both are creating them through their work. Rather than issue a test on what it means to be conservative, they deliver what the people and environment need. Both have the special qualities of great leaders: the ability to see around corners, understand the ramifications of policies and lead by example and inclusion.<br>David Post, ANNANDALE, VA, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.S. is currently engaged in an undeclared civil war between those who value individual liberty and those who think it is too dangerous. The latter group espouses a craven dependency on a government that is more than willing to micromanage our lives. The fact that you celebrate two individuals who are anathema to American values shows that Time is better suited to George Orwell’s Oceania than to the U.S. This country did not achieve greatness with a mind-set of “safety first” but rather “live free or die.”<br>Mike Glaser, CINCINNATI, OHIO, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>A September Stand-Down?</strong><br>Re Joe Klein’s “The July surprise” [July 23]: Is George W. Bush off-base on Iraq policy? With the Democrats and a few defecting Republicans clamoring for a speedy exit from Iraq, Bush has a golden opportunity to save face. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki suggested that U.S. troops could go home anytime they want. Whether or not the troop surge is fully effective, the perception remains that Bush’s policy is in the wrong ballpark.<br>Cal George, CARROLLTON, TEXAS, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bush says that he will not abandon his Iraq policy unless General David Petraeus declares it a failure in September. Regardless of the truth, I already know the basis of the general’s report. With his reputation and career at stake, Petraeus will say exactly what the President wants to hear: The surge is making progress and requires more time and more troops for success. Those familiar with big corporations know that the CEO rarely has a clear understanding of what is happening in his company. With reputations and careers at stake, a story becomes rosier as it passes up the corporate ladder. Does anyone believe the Army is any different? We have seen that retired generals, whose careers are no longer at risk, have the courage to challenge official policy.<br>King Sinclair, LOUISVILLE, KY, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bush has already achieved his main objective in invading Iraq. He formed a U.S.-style democracy that will serve as a role model for all nations in the Middle East. Members of the Iraqi Parliament have in a relatively short time acquired the necessary skills for political success: constant partisan bickering, numerous vacations, a short workweek, regular salary increases and no accomplishments. If successful, Bush would be justified in once again declaring “Mission Accomplished.” With victory in hand, he can bring the troops home.<br>Gordon Bacon, PHENIX, ARIZ., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Danger’s Warning Signs</strong><br>Amanda Ripley’s “Can we spot the threat?” questions our ability to identify a terrorist attack before it occurs [July 16]. We cannot spot terrorism, and we never could. If we were able to spot it, the Sept. 11 attacks and the London rail bombings would not have occurred. Some terrorists were apprehended before they could cause any real damage, but government officials usually do not have the situation under control. Terrorists — amateurs and professionals alike — will continue to strike when we least expect it and in places we are unlikely to look. The U.S. government has made the Western world a target. Until we make friends with the enemy, the atrocities caused by the terrorists will continue.<br>Katarzyna Radzka, GOLD COAST, AUSTRALIA</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How can we deal with the ever changing face of terrorism? Good question! As with a stray weed, we need to destroy its roots; trimming a few leaves won’t do. Searching cars and people at airports is a weak, pathetic response. We need decisive and sustained action against the organizations that recruit, brainwash and train terrorists. Unfortunately, we seem to be pouring all our efforts and resources into alleviating the symptoms rather than fighting the disease.<br>Noru Tsalic, COVENTRY, ENGLAND</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a Muslim physician trained in beautiful Britain, I was very sad to read that the people whose main responsibility was to save lives were determined to take the lives of innocent people. The terrorists not only betrayed their religion but stabbed their profession in the heart. It is not the responsibility of governments but our responsibility as enlightened Muslims to stand up to these misguided criminals.<br>Dr. Rana K. Latif, DEPARTMENT OF ANESTHESIOLOGY & PERIOPERATIVE MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE, LOUISVILLE, KY., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Isn’t it a great success for the wrong people? Terrorists may take pride in forcing more and more Western governments to establish a state of strict surveillance. The German Minister of the Interior is about to tear down almost everything that protects the privacy of citizens. Thus terrorists help to make people feel safe but permanently imprisoned. Surely, not a very pleasant way of existence.<br>Hans Gerbig, BATZENHOFEN, GERMANY</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>A Novelist Neglected</strong><br>Re Donald Morrison’s “Lost in America” [July 16]: I can’t believe that Douglas Kennedy doesn’t have a publisher in the U.S. It’s incomprehensible. I’ve read all his thrillers, each one more absorbing than the last. My idea of heaven is settling down with a scalding hot cup of tea and a Douglas Kennedy book.<br>Sara Kennelly, GALWAY, IRELAND</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Scooting Away from Justice</strong><br>It is difficult to fathom the extent to which the current U.S. Administration has gone to perpetrate clearly unconstitutional behavior in order to secure power [July 16]. What’s even more surprisaing is how removed the American public is from the systemic constitutional affronts that have taken place. The lack of national uproar over the commutation of Libby’s sentence for heinous crimes reflects that indifference. At the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was asked, “Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” He said, “A republic, if you can keep it.” I certainly hope we can.<br>Natalie Rosen, FRAMINGHAM, MASS, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So it has come to this. not only does the U.S. Vice President flout an Executive Order, but he has the unmitigated gall to tell us the branch of government to which he belongs. The President then commutes the sentence of a convicted felon who just happens to be the Vice President’s former chief of staff. It is stunning to me that almost 144 years later, the words uttered by Abraham Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address have been trampled and disregarded so callously by the four branches (now including Cheney’s hybrid branch) of our government. Indeed, it would appear that government of the people, by the people and for the people has now perished, if not from this earth, at least from the U.S.<br>Rodney K.
