Godwin Obaseki.</p><p>Uzzi urged the people of the ward to reciprocate Obaseki’s magnanimity of appointing two persons from the ward into his cabinet.</p><p>“Those tagging Gov. Obaseki as ignorant and bereft of ideas are the ones bereft of ideas. We grew together in this ward.</p><p>“While Gov. Obaseki grew up in the College area, I grew up in the Jemide area. Those who call the governor a Lagos boy do not know what they are saying,” he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On his part, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Projects, <strong>Crusoe Osagie</strong>, who also hailed from the ward, said the political dominance of APC in the ward had been defeated.</p><p>Osagie said Egede’s defection, as a chieftain of APC, with those of his supporters to PDP, was a major boost to PDP in the locality.</p><p>“In every election, one of those who give our party, PDP a sleepless night and disturb our chances of winning the ward, is Pastor Sidney Egede.</p><p>“But today, we are very happy to have him and his foot soldiers in the fold of PDP. With him, the forthcoming election will be an easy one for us.</p><p>“I want to appeal to those who are still undecided or on the fence to join the party because PDP is a party that has the welfare of Edo citizens at heart.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“With Barrister Asue Ighodalo and Barrister Osarodion Ogie as the governor and deputy governor, and successors to Gov. Obaseki, the state is again poised for more development,” said Osagie.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Egede, said they decided to join the PDP because competent and popular candidates in the APC were not given the governorship ticket.</p><p>“We are also worried by the person who won the APC ticket where we have qualified and more competent aspirants like Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and the former state Chairman of APC, David Imuse.</p><p>“Also is Ernest Afolabi Umakhihe, the former Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security,” he said.</p><p>He assured that more members in the ward from the opposition would defect to PDP before the election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46ap5xlnZq6o7HRrGSipl2kv6awzmahqKGeYr2lvIyan56ZlGKypbuMoKavnaKjvLO%2Fx6KnZp2cmrC1tc6nZm2gnKzFuLY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./produits-services.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Financement de projets dhabitat| Banque des Territoires</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20-sweet-photos-that-made-us-go-omg-my-heart-please-797126.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20 Sweet Photos That Made Us Go, OMG, My Heart, Please</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
