The program, which the company is piloting in Arizona, will give grants to qualified homebuyers worth 2% of the purchase price, lowering their down payment to as low as 1%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For a so-called starter home in Arizona that costs $275,000—an example Zillow gives <a href=#>in its press release announcing the program</a>—that means a grant of $5,500.</p><p>As Zillow economist Orphe Divounguy explains it, the company is offering the same assistance potential home buyers often receive from their parents. “In an environment where lending is tight, you have renters that are paying essentially as much, if not more, in rent than they would pay to own,” Divounguy says. “This is kind of the perfect timing to step in here and help those who have been sidelined by the fact that they don't have access to parental home equity.”</p><p>Zillow spokespeople would not say how much it expects to hand out in down payment assistance, nor what it expects will be the size of the average individual grant, but the company does hope to roll out the plan nationally. Because the program is limited to first-time buyers with income below the average in the area, the grants are unlikely to be more than $10,000.<br></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">High interest rates, low inventory</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><br>Only 4.04 million existing homes were sold in August in the U.S., the worst number for any August since 2010, according to the National Association of Realtors. According to real estate agents and housing market observers, the sluggish market is driven not just by high interest rates, but a dearth of available homes. The shortage is a product of a pandemic-related slowdown in construction and the unwillingness of existing homeowners to give up low mortgage rates they secured years ago.</p><p>“It’s a strange, strange market,” says Butch Leiber, a real estate agent and president of the Phoenix Realtors board of directors. “We have super, super low inventory. As interest rates went up, we saw buyer activity drop. The problem is, so did seller activity. If they have a mortgage, they have a 3%, 4%, 5% mortgage and they don’t want to move.” The average 30-year fixed interest rate is 8.07% as of Oct. 16, <a href=#>according to Investopedia</a>.</p><p>To encourage buyers, home builders are also trying to lower the price of borrowing. While Zillow is offering down payment assistance, builders are lowering interest rates for buyers by <a href=#>“buying down” mortgage rates</a>. In essence, they are paying a bank or mortgage originator a one-time fee in exchange for a lower interest rate. Since the biggest home builders, like Lennar and Pulte, also own mortgage origination businesses, they face less financial exposure.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Zillow isn’t a home builder, it similarly is trying to capture as much of the real estate market as possible. Founded in 2004, Seattle-based <a href=#>Zillow began as an online real estate data and listings service</a>. It has since expanded to include managing apartments, brokering rentals, and connecting buyers and sellers with agents. In 2018, it acquired Mortgage Lenders of America to enter the home-loans business. <a href=#>According to Zillow CEO and co-founder Rich Barton</a>, the company aims to double its share of all U.S. real estate transactions from 3% to 6% by 2025.<br></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Entering the "Zillow ecosphere"</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><br>By helping potential home buyers take out mortgages, Zillow locks them into its suite of real estate products and services, Leiber says. “If they can get them into the Zillow ecosphere, they will be tied to Zillow for a long time,” he says.</p><p>Creating incentives for low-income home buyers to take on debt evokes the specter of the subprime mortgage issues that helped create the global financial crisis of 2008. However, Zillow executives say the program is nothing like the high-risk mortgages offered to unqualified buyers nearly two decades ago.</p><p>“This isn't 2006, 2007,” Divounguy says. “This is a conventional 30-year fixed loan, where prospective buyers have to meet all the usual qualifications, the usual requirements.” Further, he says, there are so many well-qualified buyers needing homes, Zillow doesn’t have to loan to unqualified buyers. “Mortgage delinquency rates are lower today than they were before the pandemic or almost at any time in recorded history,” Divounguy says. “Credit scores of new homebuyers are near their highest level since we've been recording those.”</p><p>While Zillow’s program is unusual in that down-payment assistance is coming from a lender, there are many such programs run by governments and nonprofits to help first-time home buyers, particularly those in the military or those from disadvantaged groups.</p><p>Before entering any program, it makes sense to talk to a home-buying counselor, says Jackie Boies, a housing expert at Money Management International, a nonprofit that offers counseling among a range of financial education programs. While there is nothing inherently suspicious about down payment assistance, “buyers need to do a lot of homework,” she says. “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2JqfXSDjrOgpaSfrHqnvsSeZKannprGbrLOq2Shp52ar7bFxKuqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beta-films-presumed-guilty-franck-ollivier-1235001258.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beta Film Swoops on France 3 Crime Series Presumed Guilty (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gestion-quantitative-de-la-ressource-en-eau-et-des-secheresses-une-instruction-donne-le-la.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>une instruction donne le &amp;quot;la&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
