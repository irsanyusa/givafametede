Alphas hate to be laughed at, and a Sigma can often enrage an Alpha by doing nothing more than smiling at him. Everyone else is vaguely confused by them...In a social situation, the Sigma is the man who stops in briefly to say hello to a few friends accompanied by a tier 1 girl that no one has ever seen before. Sigmas like women, but tend to be contemptuous of them. They are usually considered to be strange.<p class=align-left>Sigma and Alphas are equal, but the former sits outside the hierarchy by choice.</p><p class=align-left>Sigma males are defined as rule breakers and makers. Such a man may also be defined as an introverted Alpha who lives his life his own way. He has all the best traits of the Alpha and Beta.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/197682779a55c217.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jealousy vs Envy: how does the Bible differentiate between them?</span></p></a><h2>Sigma male traits</h2><p class=align-left>What traits define a man with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sigma personality</a>? These top tier men have the following characteristics:</p><h3>1. Independence</h3><p class=align-left>Sigma males are very independent men. They work hard and do not rely on anyone or anything to get what they want in life.</p><h3>2. Introspection</h3><p class=align-left>Such a man has excellent self-awareness. He takes time to figure out what he wants and who he is emotionally and mentally. In short, he has himself all figured out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/28322320afe0261c.jpg><h3>3. Silence</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike Alphas, who are mostly loud-mouthed and want all the attention, Sigmas are the quiet type. In a room, they are the people who quietly listen to the Alpha go on about something.</p><p class=align-left>Sigmas <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">don't say much</a>. They only speak when they need to and say only what is important.</p><h3>4. Intelligence</h3><p class=align-left>They are characterized by their high IQ and wit. Most of them have an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">INTJ personality type </a>(introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d89251074fac18e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The beta male - definition, traits, and personality</span></p></a><h3>5. Troublemaking</h3><p class=align-left>They are rebels in disguise. They follow their own gut and believe that no one should infringe on their personal liberties.</p><h3>6. Loners</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike Alphas, who need an audience to feel important and superior, Sigmas enjoy their own company. They work hard to understand themselves and enjoy spending time with themselves rather than with anyone else.</p><h3>7. Capability</h3><p class=align-left>They are the men you can always count on. You can call a Sigma in the middle of the night to come to bail you out of jail, and he won't even have to reconsider helping you. Granted, he will not appreciate the disturbance, but he will show up for you at all costs.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, such a man always accomplishes everything he sets his eyes on.</p><h3>8. Charisma</h3><p class=align-left>Although quiet, once he opens his mouth, he will definitely charm you. His high IQ and wit also make him a great conversationalist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/579e939c7c1d0dd7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing Oscar Wilde quotes that every literary fan should know</span></p></a><h3>9. Confidence</h3><p class=align-left>He is a dominant introvert, and he knows it. Even though he will not rub his confidence in your face, it is evident that he is sure of himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/197682779a55c217.jpg><h3>10. Attractiveness</h3><p class=align-left>Such men have many character traits, such as their intelligence, independence, and confidence, that make them highly attractive to women. However, they may not even notice or care when they receive attention from ladies.</p><h3>11. They are hard to get</h3><p class=align-left>These men keep things so close to their chest, and that is just who they are.</p><h3>12. They do their own thing</h3><p class=align-left>These guys know that there is no point in living life according to everyone else's rules.</p><h3>13. They could be the Alpha</h3><p class=align-left>Usually, Sigma males have all the qualities of the Alpha male, but they choose to flaunt none of it.</p><h3>14. They get a lot of attention</h3><p class=align-left>They are naturally very mysterious, and everyone wants to know what's going on in their head.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9c461b58a0de0d5b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 most famous Jordan Peterson quotes of all time</span></p></a><h3>15. They hate it when someone imposes on their lifestyle</h3><p class=align-left>They love their space, and they absolutely hate it when someone comes into their life to 'shake things up.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0bbf6dbad17a8a9.jpg><h3>16. Have their own look</h3><p class=align-left>Despite not being into fashion labels, these men usually craft their own look that is unique to them.</p><h3>17. They fit anywhere</h3><p class=align-left>They blend in and out of groups effortlessly. This should not be mistaken for fitting in.</p><h3>18. Adaptability</h3><p class=align-left>They are flexible but don't always utilize that skill.</p><h3>19. They can control a room</h3><p class=align-left>Their intelligence and charismatic nature make them able to control a room.</p><h3>20. They are usually off the grid</h3><p class=align-left>Many Sigma males keep off social media.</p><h3>21. Hard to reach</h3><p class=align-left>Due to their choice to keep off social media, it may be really difficult to get hold of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d89251074fac18e6.jpg><h3>22. Live dangerously</h3><p class=align-left>Sigmas are somewhat rebels, and this makes them adventure seekers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e7212f8b1b696e29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viktor Frankl quotes from Man's Search for Meaning</span></p></a><h3>23. Accidentally abstract</h3><p class=align-left>Their silent nature makes them seem mysterious, hence making them stand out.</p><h3>24. Deep thinkers</h3><p class=align-left>They take their time to think about something carefully.</p><h3>25. Intriguing and intrigued</h3><p class=align-left>They are the type of people who will charm you with their conversations. They don't just talk about anything. This tends to intrigue people. Similarly, they like to be intrigued by meaningful conversations.</p><h3>26. They do not want to be the top dog</h3><p class=align-left>In all honesty, Sigmas don't even want to be part of the pack.</p><h3>27. They treat people equally and are respectful</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike Alphas, who might seem like they don't care about anyone but themselves, Sigmas are quite the opposite. They understand that everyone matters and will treat anyone and everyone with respect.</p><h2>Dating a Sigma male</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/579e939c7c1d0dd7.jpg><p class=align-left>Not anyone can date a Sigma male.
