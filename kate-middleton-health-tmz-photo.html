The images follow weeks of unrelenting online speculation, and even <a href=#>conspiracy theories</a>, about her health and whereabouts. The royal was last seen with Prince William and their children during Christmas festivities in Norfolk, England, but there have been no appearances or images of her since.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">U.K. Army Removes Claim Kate Middleton Will Attend Event Amid Ongoing Speculation</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales’s uncle <a href=#>Gary Goldsmith</a> became a contestant on the British reality TV show Big Brother on Monday evening, and <a href=#>said</a> his niece is in a “nice house somewhere” recuperating from surgery.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kensington Palace issued a statement in January announcing that Kate had undergone abdominal surgery in January and would recover—out of the spotlight—until after Easter. The statement added that it was her desire to maintain “as much normality for her children as possible” and to keep her medical information private.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But social media users and royal observers began sharing all kinds of conspiracy theories about Kate’s extended absence in the meantime. Kate was <a href=#>discharged on Jan. 29</a>, after two weeks in hospital, with Kensington Palace announcing that she was “making good progress” and recuperating at their family home in Windsor.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Kate Middleton and the History of Royal Secrecy on Health Issues</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prince William had paused his royal engagements while Kate was recovering but he returned to duties on Feb. 7 for an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle. Earlier this week, there was much discussion about the Army posting on its website that Kate was due to take part in the royal family’s annual Trooping the Colour parade on June 8. However, as of Wednesday morning, any mention of Kate appearing at the event <a href=#>has been removed</a> from the Army's post.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speculation over the Princess of Wales’s health and whereabouts comes at a sensitive time for the royal family, after Buckingham Palace disclosed last month that King Charles had been diagnosed with <a href=#>a form of cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No major British outlets have published the TMZ images so far. “There are pap picture of the Princess of Wales. We are not running them out of respect for her privacy whilst she recovers from her operation in the timescale we were given for it,” wrote Chris Ship, ITV’s royal editor, in a <a href=#>post</a> on X. “As far as I know, no other UK broadcaster or newspaper has published the photos either.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The royal family has a long history of secrecy about medical information, but the Princess and Prince of Wales have previously been candid about medical matters, including pregnancy and mental health.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That’s why William and Kate’s reticence about what's going on with them is odd,” royal historian Clare McHugh previously told TIME.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcGNshHR%2BjqSYrZ1doralsMueq6imXZ2yorjToWStpapivam706hm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rfk-jr-campaign-vice-president-announcement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RFK Jr.'s Campaign Prepares For a Pivotal Moment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hipster-or-halloween-costume-new-blog-lets-readers-be-the-judge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hipster or Halloween Costume?
