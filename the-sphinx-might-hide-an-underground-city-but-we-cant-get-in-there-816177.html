It’s one of&nbsp;the most majestic monuments of&nbsp;humankind. The wonder of&nbsp;the ancient world hides a&nbsp;<strong>secret</strong> that scientists and archaeologists still can’t solve. This is&nbsp;the <strong>Great Sphinx of&nbsp;Giza</strong> in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/025/822/daa0c05c6aa4a37f0352aaf7bf.jpeg><p>The huge sculpture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lion with a&nbsp;human head was carved out of&nbsp;<a href=# title=rock data-link=tag>rock</a> about <strong>4.5 thousand years ago</strong>. Scientists still don’t know the exact date of&nbsp;its creation and are also unaware of&nbsp;who built it&nbsp;and what for. There are many assumptions and theories, but none of&nbsp;them has been confirmed. Most people have seen this majestic sculpture either in&nbsp;photographs or&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=reality data-link=tag>reality</a>, but almost no&nbsp;one knows what’s hidden underneath&nbsp;it.</p><p>The statue of&nbsp;the Sphinx was carved from a&nbsp;single piece of&nbsp;<strong>limestone</strong>. It&nbsp;was painted&nbsp;— the remains of&nbsp;color pigment on&nbsp;the surface prove this. In&nbsp;the distant past, the Sphinx looked much brighter and more colorful than what we&nbsp;see now. But even after thousands of&nbsp;years, its greatness hasn’t diminished. And by&nbsp;the way, Sphinx is&nbsp;not the real name. It&nbsp;was invented by&nbsp;the Greeks about a&nbsp;hundred years or&nbsp;more after its creation.</p><p>Initially, the Egyptians called the statue<strong> Horemakhet</strong>. There are many legends and theories saying the Sphinx is&nbsp;there for a&nbsp;reason&nbsp;— it’s like a&nbsp;watchdog that guards the tomb of&nbsp;the Pharaoh and the secrets of&nbsp;Ancient Egypt. These legends became more plausible when archaeologists discovered hidden entrances at&nbsp;the feet of&nbsp;the Sphinx. They believe that these secret passages are the beginning of&nbsp;the tunnels leading to&nbsp;the halls with treasures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/38a/3e6/4155d956e0aa100c7935a74aa9.jpeg><p>You can find a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stories on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Internet data-link=tag>Internet</a> that claim the Sphinx hides the Hall of&nbsp;Records&nbsp;— a&nbsp;repository filled with ancient and secret knowledge. One of&nbsp;the main artifacts of&nbsp;this repository is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the records of&nbsp;the ancient mythical state of&nbsp;<strong>Atlantis</strong>. According to&nbsp;legends, the entire library from this city was moved under the Sphinx. The entrance to&nbsp;this library must be&nbsp;located next to&nbsp;the Sphinx’s right paw. Many archaeologists tried to&nbsp;find this entrance but came away empty-handed.</p><p>Also, there are many images with detailed diagrams of&nbsp;the underground city that consists of&nbsp;a&nbsp;network of&nbsp;tunnels and chambers under the Sphinx. Someone says there are structures as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;12-story buildings hiding underground. But there’s no&nbsp;evidence of&nbsp;this. Archaeologists, even after millennia, continue to&nbsp;explore the mysterious sculpture. At&nbsp;the same time, many Egyptians don’t want to&nbsp;learn more about the Sphinx. They’re terrified of&nbsp;awakening something <a href=# title=supernatural data-link=tag>supernatural</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>1998</strong>, scientists discovered tunnels leading to&nbsp;empty caves under the Sphinx. They found evidence of&nbsp;earlier excavations there. It’s quite possible that someone managed to&nbsp;find the treasures and take them away. Some people believe Egyptians found some kind of&nbsp;artifact under the Sphinx that has the power of&nbsp;unknown advanced technologies. The artifact is&nbsp;so&nbsp;powerful that it&nbsp;can change the course of&nbsp;history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/beb/9d7/b58c4d55fd8b626148b1ca200c.jpeg><p>Of&nbsp;course, most theories are just fairy tales of&nbsp;conspiracy fans. But it’s a&nbsp;confirmed fact that the Sphinx hides a&nbsp;system of&nbsp;caves and rooms. There are so&nbsp;many rumors surrounding the Sphinx that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;understand what is&nbsp;true and what is&nbsp;false. In&nbsp;any case, it’s difficult and dangerous to&nbsp;study the sculpture because active excavations can destroy&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then the entrance to&nbsp;the underground rooms can get blocked by&nbsp;rocks and lost forever. Also, further exploration requires a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money, and financing is&nbsp;not always easy to&nbsp;find. But the main reason? It’s too risky. There’s no&nbsp;guarantee that people will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;the underground labyrinths. For these reasons, scientists and archaeologists have been exploring this majestic structure for so&nbsp;long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/86e/d84/1f27ff575ea1fa0d9952a881bc.jpeg><p>Another famous architectural monument with a&nbsp;secret is&nbsp;<strong>Mount Rushmore</strong> in&nbsp;South Dakota. Everyone admires the images of&nbsp;the&nbsp;US presidents’ faces carved into the rock, but few people know that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret room hidden behind the head of&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>The architect of&nbsp;Mount Rushmore<strong> </strong>wanted to&nbsp;carve slabs on&nbsp;the rock with the record of&nbsp;the main stages of&nbsp;the country’s history. But his plan was too complicated to&nbsp;carry out. Then, he&nbsp;was offered to&nbsp;implement it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;much smaller scale&nbsp;— to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;secret room inside the mountain. The idea was to&nbsp;save this knowledge so&nbsp;that future generations will always remember the history of&nbsp;their country.</p><p>Unfortunately, the architect didn’t have time to&nbsp;finish his work. The construction stopped for several decades. But in&nbsp;the late 90s, the project was resumed. Porcelain enamel panels depicting the history of&nbsp;the&nbsp;US were placed in&nbsp;the room. It’s possible that these plates will be&nbsp;stored there forever. But people can’t see them, at&nbsp;least for now. The room is&nbsp;inaccessible to&nbsp;tourists, as&nbsp;it’s too difficult to&nbsp;get inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/8ea/0ab/e2ffcc594398a9c957bd31c4a5.jpeg><p>Another secret room is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;the <strong>Empire State Building</strong>. More precisely, it’s not even a&nbsp;room but a&nbsp;place where you can take cool photos. Almost all tourists gather on&nbsp;the observation deck of&nbsp;the 86th floor to&nbsp;enjoy a&nbsp;stunning view of&nbsp;Manhattan. But there’s another deck with panoramic windows on&nbsp;the 102nd floor.<strong> </strong>There are way fewer people there because almost no&nbsp;one knows about that place.</p><p>Fortunately, access to&nbsp;this deck is&nbsp;open to&nbsp;everyone. You probably won’t have to&nbsp;wait in&nbsp;line for a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;photo. You will feel special because you’re in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;secret place where there are almost no&nbsp;people. But the coolest place is&nbsp;even higher, on&nbsp;the 103rd floor. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;spacious observation deck where celebrities get their photographs taken. It’s not a&nbsp;public place, but if&nbsp;you know the right people, you can get there.</p><p>There are almost no&nbsp;security measures on&nbsp;the site, only a&nbsp;low ledge between you and an&nbsp;abyss. That’s why crowds of&nbsp;people are forbidden from coming here. It’s not so&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;get there, and you are unlikely to&nbsp;succeed without a&nbsp;guide. First, you need to&nbsp;choose the right elevator that will take you there. Then you’ll go&nbsp;through several engineering rooms filled with pipes, electrical panels, and other technical stuff. The final part of&nbsp;your way is&nbsp;a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;stairs inside a&nbsp;tiny corridor. And here you are&nbsp;— at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;New York!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/dc4/a91/12461153618a56af329decc92a.jpeg><p>Now we’re in&nbsp;Paris. See the Eiffel Tower? Inside&nbsp;it, there are restaurants and observation decks. But if&nbsp;you try hard, you can find a&nbsp;secret apartment. Now it’s a&nbsp;museum. But it&nbsp;was built so&nbsp;that people could live in&nbsp;it. The architect of&nbsp;the tower, <strong>Gustave Eiffel</strong>, created this apartment in&nbsp;<strong>1889</strong> for himself. It’s almost at&nbsp;the very top of&nbsp;the Eiffel Tower. Imagine what a&nbsp;beautiful view he&nbsp;observed every day. He&nbsp;was the first and only tenant. No&nbsp;one else could gain access to&nbsp;this place.</p><p>When the architect passed away, the apartment remained empty for a&nbsp;long time.<strong> </strong>Only recently, they restored it&nbsp;and turned it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;museum. Inside, the epoch of&nbsp;the last century is&nbsp;recreated. They even put wax figures of&nbsp;Gustave Eiffel, his daughter, and the American inventor <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> inside the room. This place is&nbsp;filled with an&nbsp;endless stream of&nbsp;passengers, office workers running late, visitors from other cities... Noise, train whistles.</p><p>At&nbsp;Grand Central Station in&nbsp;New York, among all these sounds, you can hear the sound of&nbsp;a&nbsp;ball hitting a&nbsp;racket&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you’re in&nbsp;the right place. A&nbsp;real tennis court is&nbsp;hidden inside New York Central Station. It&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tennis club that arranges corporate games for employees of&nbsp;many companies. The club was opened in&nbsp;the 60s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/520/8d3/9f34f75f5dbb300144c4b26708.jpeg><p>Now, we’re moving to&nbsp;London, <strong>Charing Cross Road</strong>. It&nbsp;isn’t easy to&nbsp;find one secret place here. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you need to&nbsp;look carefully at&nbsp;your feet. Do&nbsp;you see these sewer grates in&nbsp;the asphalt? Inside them, you can notice two signs with the name <strong>Little Compton Street</strong>. Yeah, there’s another street right below you! It&nbsp;disappeared from all maps at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the <strong>19th century</strong>. Charing Cross Road was built over&nbsp;it. The identification signs that you see are part of&nbsp;old engineering tunnels.</p><p>There’s another interesting place in&nbsp;London. It’s located in&nbsp;the southeast corner of&nbsp;<strong>Trafalgar Square</strong>. At&nbsp;first glance, it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;thick lamppost. But there are too many tourists walking around. You come closer and realize that one person can easily fit inside the post. The “lamppost” belongs not to&nbsp;an&nbsp;electrician but to&nbsp;a&nbsp;police officer. Yeah, this is&nbsp;the smallest police station in&nbsp;the world. It&nbsp;was built in&nbsp;the <strong>1930s</strong> and used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;watch-post. Officers had to&nbsp;sit there one by&nbsp;one and watch Trafalgar Square that always attracted a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pickpockets and all kinds of&nbsp;other criminals.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysp6Ghnq16rrXGoatmoJmZsm6tzWasp5yVp7Szu9Snm2abmanGbq7UrWSwnV2Yrq%2FAjKCcrWWZo3q1tMSrnGZwYWt%2BeIOO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./two-who-slipped-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Two Who Slipped Away | TIME</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./saturday-night-live-sydney-sweeney-willy-wonka-1235928487.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sydney Sweeney and Chloe Troast Decorate Terrible Airbnbs Including the Willy Wonka Experience</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
