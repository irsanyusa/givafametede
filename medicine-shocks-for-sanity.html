Both types of treatment are mechanical, differ from chemical injections of insulin or metrazol, which are widely used in hospitals throughout the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Electric Current. Four years ago, two doctors in Rome named Ugo Cerletti and L. Bini passed an electric current through a dog’s brain, gave him a mild convulsion without doing him any harm. They next attempted to faradize psychiatric patients back to normality. Dr. Lothar Kalinowsky of Berlin introduced the new technique to Paris and London, is now working in Manhattan’s New York State Psychiatric Institute.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A patient with schizophrenia or manic-depressive psychosis (alternating fits of madness and despair) is placed on his back on a table. Two electrodes on a forceps-like spring are set firmly on his temples.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The electrodes are pads of soft rubber sponge covered with interlacing bands of thin copper strip, and are attached to a small electric transformer and timing device. A current of 70 to 100 volts is passed from one side of the patient’s head to the other for about one-tenth of a second.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As soon as the electric circuit is closed, the patient becomes unconscious. Then his limbs begin to twitch and he falls into a fit closely resembling epilepsy. In a few minutes he awakens, with no recollection of the convulsion. Treatments are given about three times a week, for several weeks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So far, over 10,000 convulsions have been given to patients abroad and in the U.S. The proportion of improvement depends upon the type and length of illness, is about the same as for insulin and metrazol—estimates range roughly from IS to 50%. But of course psychiatrists do not yet know how permanent any shock treatment is over a period of years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although electric shock may not replace the standard insulin treatment, most psychiatrists think it far superior to metrazol. Its advantages: 1) the convulsions are not usually as violent as those produced by metrazol; 2) since patients lose consciousness immediately, they do not remember the frightening “aura” that precedes a metrazol convulsion; 3) electric treatment is much cheaper than insulin or metrazol—a machine costs less than $300. But electric shock is safe only in the hands of a trained psychiatrist.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Famed Psychiatrist Abraham Myerson of Boston declared last week that he successfully used electric shocks for 40 cases of early depression. Dr. Lauren Howe Smith and colleagues of Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Hospital claimed that electric shock calmed noisy patients in the wards cut their length of stay in half.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Frozen Sleep. Drs. John Harold Talbot and Kenneth James Tillotson of Harvard tried to cool the fevered minds of ten schizophrenics by refrigerating their bodies. They used the same method tried in many hospitals for relieving pain of cancer patients. The schizophrenics were wrapped in rubberized refrigerating blankets. When their temperature dropped a little below 90°, they began to talk “clearly, logically and with insight.” Prize patient was a 26-year-old woman medical-school student, who received three treatments several months apart. Her zone of cold reason, the doctors said, seemed to lie between 89 and 95°. Whenever she reached 96, she relapsed into insanity. After her third treatment, she “was again an intelligent, social person.” At times she still reverts to her schizophrenic state, but her general condition is better.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of the ten patients, four showed “striking and continuous improvement,” three temporary improvement. Two remained the same. One died.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ub2xpaYZwucSdoJyhnpp6tLTOnKKsZZakv26%2FwKegrbFf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sexy-beast-review-paramount-1235882201.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Padded-Out Prequel Sexy Beast Weighs Down the Cult Crime Classic: TV Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bestiality-man-rapes-family-dog-because-wife-gave-it-too-much-attention.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Man rapes family dog because wife gave it too much attention</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
