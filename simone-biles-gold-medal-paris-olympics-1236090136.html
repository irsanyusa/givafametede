captured the one thing greater than gold — she seemingly reclaimed her joy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Biles was already the greatest gymnast — male or female — in history, with seven Olympic medals (four gold) and 30 World Championship medals. But, at the <a href=# id=auto-tag_paris-olympics data-tag=paris-olympics>Paris Olympics</a>, she had another goal: to compete on her terms and enjoy every moment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And enjoy it she did — when it was announced early Tuesday that women of Team USA gymnastics were golden again, Biles quite literally jumped for joy. Then, she streamed through the arena carrying a giant American flag so she and her teammates Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee and Hezly Rivera could pose for photographers. (The team win pushed Biles past Shannon Miller to claim the crown as the most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast of all time.)</p><h2 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-050 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/featured_postwar_streaming_SR.jpg alt="Tattered white flag flying with a streaming symbol" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="c-span lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase u-font-family-basic lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-padding-b-075 lrv-u-font-size-12 u-font-size-13@tablet u-color-brand-vip-primary"><a href=# class="c-span__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">VIP+</a></span><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore">The Postwar Streaming Market: A Special Report</a></h3><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/West-Wing-Reunion-Emmys.jpg alt="LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 15: (L-R) Janel Moloney, Dulé Hill, Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, and Richard Schiff speak onstage during the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater on September 15, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

And I think we all had something to prove from Tokyo and tonight we did just that.”</p><h3>Popular on Variety</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Biles has called these games the “Redemption Tour” because the four athletes who competed in the 2020 Tokyo games — Carey, Chiles, Lee and herself (16-year-old Rivera is the rookie Olympian) — had faced major challenges since, from injury and illness to struggles with skills and self-confidence. This team was not only on a quest to best that silver medal, but to make a statement about all they’d overcome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/featured_postwar_streaming_SR.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Biles has been candid about her mental health journey since Tokyo, where she scratched from the team finals with a bout of the twisties (a dangerous phenomenon where a gymnast loses track of their body while in the air). The first two episodes of Netflix docuseries “<a href=# id=auto-tag_simone-biles-rising data-tag=simone-biles-rising>Simone Biles Rising</a>” captured the behind-the-scenes drama of that moment, how Biles dealt with the fallout and what it took for her to mount this incredible comeback. For the last five years, documentarian Katie Walsh filmed the Olympian off and on; Walsh and a crew were on the sidelines in Paris filming for part two, out this fall.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“’Simone Biles Rising’” plays like three years’ worth of Biles’ diary entries, as she expresses her truth and reclaims her voice,” Variety TV critic Aramide Tinubu <a href=#>wrote in her review</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With the docuseries, Tinubu adds, “Biles tasks herself and the audience to examine what can happen if sportsmen are allowed to put their mental health on equal footing with their physical well-being. The noise around you can only be silenced for so long, but when you take charge of the things you’ve been told to feel shame about and trust yourself to live life on your terms, that’s true freedom.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">There’s been an obvious shift in Biles’ demeanor between the Tokyo and Paris Olympics. You can see the difference on her social media, for example. After the qualifying round in 2021, she <a rel=nofollow href=#>posted to Instagram</a> with the caption: “Prelims [check] now to prepare for finals. It wasn’t an easy day or my best but I got through it. I truly do feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders. I know I brush it off and make it seem like pressure doesn’t affect me but damn sometimes it’s hard hahaha! The olympics is no joke!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Conversely, after qualifying in Paris on Sunday, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Biles wrote simply</a>: “Grateful to be doing what I love.” Then, just before finals began, Biles posted a TikTok set to Megan Thee Stallion’s “Where Them Girls At,” showing off her competition hair, nails and bejeweled leotard evoking the American flag (and a throwback to the 1996 team’s outfits).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@simonebilesowens href=# rel=nofollow>@simonebilesowens</a><p>aayyyyeeee team final lets get it !!!!!</p><a title="♬ Where Them Girls At - Megan Thee Stallion" href=# rel=nofollow>♬ Where Them Girls At – Megan Thee Stallion</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the opening moments of Tuesday’s broadcast, Laurie Hernandez — Biles’ teammate at the 2016 Rio games — praised the gymnast for the strides she’s taken, including doing therapy once a week. (Biles had a session on Tuesday morning, she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>reporters</a> at the Bercy Arena after the meet. “I was feeling calm and ready,” she said.) At 27, Hernandez noted, Biles is one among a growing number of gymnasts competing well into their 20s.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This is the oldest team that the United States has seen in quite some time,” Hernandez said. “I do believe it’s because of athletes like Simone talking about mental health and how paying attention to the mind and training smarter, not harder, is something that should be done more often.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cheering Biles on from the audience were her parents, Ronald and Nellie Biles, and her husband, NFL player Jonathan Owens (who negotiated time off from the Chicago Bears’ mandatory preseason practices to see Biles compete at the Olympics). The crowd was also full of celebrities like Michael Phelps and Serena Williams (the GOATs of swimming and tennis, respectively); Oscar winners Spike Lee, Nicole Kidman and Natalie Portman; Jason and Kylie Kelce; and “Today” anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Throughout Tuesday’s competition, Biles wasn’t perfect — wobbling on the balance beam and stepping out of bounds twice during her high-flying floor exercise routine — but she was totally unfazed, rolling her eyes at the latter mistake instead of beating herself up.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">By the time the meet was over, it was evident that her comeback was complete and a new, more joyful era of Biles’ career had begun. Case in point: immediately after winning the U.S. gold, the NBC broadcast caught live audio of Biles and Lee discussing what TikTok they’d make to celebrate. See the finished product below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@sunisalee_ href=# rel=nofollow>@sunisalee_</a><p>OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALISTSSSS 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</p><a title="♬ original sound - findgodye" href=# rel=nofollow>♬ original sound – findgodye</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 2024 team becomes the fourth group of U.S. gymnasts to win the Olympic gold medal, following 1996’s “Magnificent Seven,” 2012’s “Fierce Five” and 2016’s “Final Five” (of which Biles was a part). At the press conference after the competition [<a rel=nofollow href=#>via Yahoo Sports</a>], Olympic champion Aly Raisman asked what their team nickname was. After some hesitation, Biles shared an abbreviated version of the NSFW answer: F.A.A.F.O. for “F— around and find out.” (She later clarified that the name was an inside joke, then posted on social media that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official name is the “Golden Girls”</a> because they’re the oldest team to date.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During the press conference [per <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Time</a>], Biles reflected on her experience on the U.S. National Team, including her early years training at the Karolyi Ranch where “nobody really talked or laughed” during practice. The prevailing belief was that having fun didn’t lead to success.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was like, that’s not how I do gymnastics,” Biles recalled. Thankfully, that culture is changing. “We show off our personalities and really have fun, but know that once we get on the floor, we’ve put in the work and it shows in the results. And we don’t have to be put in a box any more.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Biles’s Olympic Games are far from over. She’ll next compete on Thursday in the all-around competition (a historic showdown between the last two champions, Lee and herself), as well as event finals for vault, balance beam and floor exercise. That final routine begins with the opening chords of Taylor Swift’s anthem “…Ready for It?” and it’s safe to say Biles’ reputation as the GOAT has been fully restored.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/West-Wing-Reunion-Emmys.jpg><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap lrv-a-font-primary-s o-nav__title a-content-ignore lrv-u-margin-r-050">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s" aria-labelledby><li class="o-nav__list-item lrv-u-margin-l-00 lrv-u-display-inline u-line-height-inherit-important"><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s u-vertical-align-top" href=#>Olympics,</a></li><li class="o-nav__list-item lrv-u-margin-l-00 lrv-u-display-inline u-line-height-inherit-important"><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s u-vertical-align-top" href=#>Paris Olympics,</a></li><li class="o-nav__list-item lrv-u-margin-l-00 lrv-u-display-inline u-line-height-inherit-important"><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s u-vertical-align-top" href=#>Simone Biles,</a></li><li class="o-nav__list-item lrv-u-margin-l-00 lrv-u-display-inline u-line-height-inherit-important"><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-a-font-secondary-regular-s u-vertical-align-top" href=#>Simone Biles Rising</a></li></ul><a class="c-link lrv-u-cursor-pointer lrv-a-font-primary-xs u-color-black lrv-u-text-transform-capitalize lrv-a-icon-after a-icon-long-down-arrow-black a-icon-medium-grey:hover u-color-medium-grey:hover lrv-u-display-flex lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-justify-content-center a-content-ignore" href=#>Jump to Comments</a><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-text-align-center@mobile-max lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-075 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">More from Variety</h2><ul class="lrv-a-grid lrv-a-cols2@tablet lrv-a-cols3@desktop lrv-u-align-items-stretch u-column-gap-050-important // lrv-a-unstyle-list"><li class="lrv-u-border-b-1 u-border-color-light-grey-tint-two"><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TheyWillBeDust.jpg alt="They Will Be Dust" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=c-title-they-will-be-dust-review-1236136091 class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link">‘They Will Be Dust’ Review: Carlos Marqués-Marcet Orchestrates a Delicate Dance with Death in Lively Musical</a></h3><ul class="lrv-u-flex lrv-u-order-n1 lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 u-letter-spacing-012 // lrv-u-margin-b-00"></ul><ul class="lrv-a-unstyle-list // lrv-u-font-size-12 lrv-u-font-family-primary lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-black"></ul></li><li class="lrv-u-border-b-1 u-border-color-light-grey-tint-two"><a href=# class="c-lazy-image__link lrv-a-unstyle-link"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/featured_theater_survey_8b222b.jpg alt="The interior of a movie theater with two hands showing a thumbs up and thumbs down on the screen" height width decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 id=c-title-roku-nrg-streaming-movie-theater-survey-1236141061 class="c-title lrv-a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-display-block u-margin-b-075@tablet u-color-medium-grey:hover a-content-ignore"><a href=# class="c-title__link lrv-a-unstyle-link">Does Streaming Hurt Theaters?
