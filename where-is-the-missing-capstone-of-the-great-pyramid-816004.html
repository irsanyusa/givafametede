It’s so&nbsp;hot outside that you can fry eggs on&nbsp;the road.</p><p>You’ve been building the pyramid for decades. And now, when it’s finally done, you enjoy the result of&nbsp;the colossal work of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;people. You’re looking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant cultural monument of&nbsp;global value that will freeze in&nbsp;time and amaze people for tens of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/7f8/6d2/535e695d4492717ce4afe03add.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;few thousand years have passed. People in&nbsp;the 21st century see the pyramids and were like: “Wow! I&nbsp;can’t believe humans have built this.” Yeah, the people who built the pyramids wouldn’t have appreciated such a&nbsp;theory. But actually, there are reasons to&nbsp;believe that people built it&nbsp;using some fantastic <a href=# title=technology data-link=tag>technology</a>.</p><p>From the outside, it&nbsp;seems the Great Pyramids are just big triangles of&nbsp;stone. People just put some heavy blocks on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;each other, and that’s it! In&nbsp;fact, the design seems too perfect to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true. The pyramid consists of&nbsp;more than two million blocks. They lay so&nbsp;close to&nbsp;each other and are so&nbsp;even that you couldn’t squeeze even a&nbsp;thin sheet of&nbsp;paper between them. Scientists still can’t figure out the exact technology for building the Egyptian pyramids.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the biggest and most famous is&nbsp;the Great Pyramid of&nbsp;Giza. This huge construction, well-known all over the world, has one big secret. There should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;capstone on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the pyramid. It’s a&nbsp;triangular-shaped stone block, a&nbsp;small pyramid on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge one. It’s also called a&nbsp;Pyramidion. The builders of&nbsp;Ancient Egypt made it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;granite and limestone and covered it&nbsp;with <a href=# title=gold data-link=tag>gold</a>. No&nbsp;records or&nbsp;old drawings prove that there was a&nbsp;Pyramidion at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the Great Pyramid of&nbsp;Giza.</p><p>But there’s another ancient Egyptian structure with such a&nbsp;triangle&nbsp;—<strong> the Red Pyramid</strong>. It&nbsp;was built before the Great One, and its capstone has survived to&nbsp;this day. Archaeologists have found and reconstructed&nbsp;it. But where could the capstone of&nbsp;the Great Pyramid be? It’s a&nbsp;mystery that still has no&nbsp;answer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/6d1/bb0/0f83a35ac78b8a72fc2a48541a.jpeg><p>Some are sure that some thieves have stolen it&nbsp;from the top. Maybe they just climbed up&nbsp;and pushed the Pyramidion down. It&nbsp;makes perfect sense: the capstone was probably the most valuable element of&nbsp;the pyramid. Many scientists and archaeologists still don’t know its exact purpose. Some believe that this peak covered with gold glorified the Pharaohs. The capstone reflected moonlight at&nbsp;night and illuminated the entire <a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a> around&nbsp;it. During the day, the capstone reflected sunlight with its shiny surface. You could have noticed it&nbsp;from afar.</p><p>The top of&nbsp;the pyramid was a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;guiding star for lost travelers. All other stone blocks of&nbsp;the pyramid consist of&nbsp;limestone. People polished them to&nbsp;make them look shiny. In&nbsp;the past, they were even glowing and reflected light. You could see glowing pyramids from space, although they looked like tiny lights.</p><p>Over thousands of&nbsp;years, winds, sand storms, and rains have changed the pyramids’ appearance. If&nbsp;people had taken care of&nbsp;them all this time, they would have looked like something out of&nbsp;science fiction movies or&nbsp;the pyramids from Las Vegas. But unfortunately, we&nbsp;will never see their original appearance. Some archaeologists and scientists believe that the capstone could absorb the sun’s energy and distribute it&nbsp;evenly throughout the pyramid.</p><p>No&nbsp;one knows precisely why the Egyptians needed this technology. There’s a&nbsp;theory the pyramids are ancient energy systems. The Pharaohs applied this energy to&nbsp;use some unique technologies that were more advanced than all the achievements of&nbsp;the 21st century. And the triangular shape of&nbsp;the pyramids was ideal for boosting this electromagnetic energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/782/b84/5dc5e25a9eb88f5f346bca0215.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;theory, solar radiation or&nbsp;electromagnetic forces accumulated at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the pyramid, filled the inner rooms, and then went down the walls to&nbsp;the base. Any surface distortion could prevent the flow from spreading, so&nbsp;they had to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;perfectly smooth surface. That’s why they installed the blocks so&nbsp;that nobody could squeeze a&nbsp;needle or&nbsp;razor blade between them. Many people believe in&nbsp;this theory because they built the pyramids from limestone. This material can hold energy inside itself.</p><p>In&nbsp;the inner part, they created granite deposits to&nbsp;cause air ionization, that&nbsp;is, to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;electric charge. They also dug channels under the pyramid for water to&nbsp;transmit electricity. And at&nbsp;the top, they put a&nbsp;gold capstone&nbsp;— the best conductor of&nbsp;electricity. So, this is&nbsp;how you get a&nbsp;great power generator. Different cultures used similar technologies to&nbsp;create electricity all over the world. But these are all theories. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been working, humanity would have used these technologies today.</p><p>There are mentions of&nbsp;the <strong>metal industry</strong>, <strong>chemistry</strong>, <strong>engineering</strong>, <strong>physics</strong>, <strong>mathematics</strong>, and <strong>astronomy</strong> in&nbsp;some ancient records. Most scientists don’t believe in&nbsp;all these things. We&nbsp;know the detailed stages of&nbsp;the technologies’ development in&nbsp;different cultures. In&nbsp;the 21st century, scientists, historians, and anthropologists can track the evolution of&nbsp;all modern devices.</p><p>If&nbsp;people had created some technological inventions in&nbsp;ancient times, the history of&nbsp;the world would have looked different. Perhaps, all the achievements of&nbsp;antiquity could have been wiped off the face of&nbsp;the Earth by&nbsp;global cataclysms. And it&nbsp;can happen to&nbsp;us. Just imagine how people would dig up&nbsp;a&nbsp;laptop in&nbsp;five thousand years. Perhaps, they wouldn’t understand what kind of&nbsp;device it&nbsp;is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/1de/dec/bac4395b9d8b8fc64768450ca1.jpeg><p>Another Egyptian wonder surrounded by&nbsp;mystery is&nbsp;the statue of&nbsp;the Sphinx. The Egyptians carved it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single massive piece of&nbsp;limestone about 4.5 thousand years ago. But scientists still don’t know the exact date of&nbsp;its construction or&nbsp;who built&nbsp;it. People painted the Sphinx in&nbsp;different colors, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;looked much brighter and more vivid in&nbsp;the distant past. It&nbsp;was shining just like the Great Pyramids. Anyway, time hasn’t only changed its appearance, but its name, too.</p><p>Initially, the Egyptians called it&nbsp;<strong>Horemakhet</strong>. The Greeks renamed it&nbsp;the Sphinx about a&nbsp;few hundred years after it&nbsp;had been built. The Sphinx emphasized the greatness of&nbsp;the rulers of&nbsp;Egypt. It&nbsp;also performed the symbolic function of&nbsp;a&nbsp;watchdog guarding the tomb of&nbsp;the Pharaoh and the paths leading to&nbsp;it. This version sounds realistic since archaeologists have discovered many secret entrances at&nbsp;the foot of&nbsp;the Sphinx.</p><p>Perhaps these rooms and intricate tunnels lead to&nbsp;underground halls with treasures. And treasures don’t always mean gold and jewelry. According to&nbsp;legends and theories, the Sphinx guards the Hall of&nbsp;Records&nbsp;— the storage of&nbsp;all humankind’s knowledge. The information about the ancient mythical state of&nbsp;Atlantis could be&nbsp;there. You can find many detailed maps of&nbsp;the internal dungeons of&nbsp;the Sphinx on&nbsp;the Internet. They show structures 12&nbsp;stories deep under the statue. It&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;small city filled with gold, scrolls of&nbsp;knowledge, and various ancient artifacts.</p><p>But don’t believe all these maps. These are just theories. Several thousand years have passed, but people have very little information about&nbsp;it. Archaeologists know that there are still many strange and exciting things about the Sphinx that are still undiscovered. Some locals are afraid to&nbsp;research because they believe they can awake something terrible from the underground depths. Therefore, it’s mostly scientists from other countries who conduct the excavations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/28e/c9c/bee360560f8e7846226b9ffdb6.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;1998, scientists discovered strange tunnels leading to&nbsp;empty rooms under the Sphinx. They realized that some people tried to&nbsp;get there through tunnels in&nbsp;the past. And maybe those people took all the treasures that were there. One of&nbsp;the legends says that some powerful artifact lays beneath the Sphinx. Its technology can change the whole world, but the locals are hiding it&nbsp;because it&nbsp;can damage the planet.</p><p>Some believe that you can find evidence of&nbsp;unknown technologies painted on&nbsp;the granite walls in&nbsp;the Pharaoh’s tombs. But most likely, these paintings and signs tell&nbsp;us the myths and legends of&nbsp;Ancient Egypt. But what if&nbsp;Egyptian symbols and drawings are detailed instructions for using ancient technologies? What if&nbsp;the locals that lived at&nbsp;that time thought: “Hmm, people in&nbsp;the future won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;get energy themselves. Let’s leave some detailed instructions for them!”</p><p>Anyway, there are many riddles and theories. In&nbsp;reality, the search for answers is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dangerous undertaking since it’s not easy to&nbsp;get into the underground halls. Excavations can ruin the structure of&nbsp;the entire Sphinx. Any person inside the tunnels may get lost and never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find their way back. Besides, it&nbsp;costs a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money. Now what would be&nbsp;awesome is&nbsp;if&nbsp;people could invent some device that could scan underground areas and show their detailed models.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpsdGeZKKrXam1pnnMoqqsoZ6ceqStz6yrqKaVYrynedOhnGafopqutXnPsqmapZmZenl9lWlnbWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-sweet-photos-that-made-us-go-omg-my-heart-please-797126.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Sweet Photos That Made Us Go, OMG, My Heart, Please</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-looking-video-games-2016.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Best-Looking Video Games of 2016</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
