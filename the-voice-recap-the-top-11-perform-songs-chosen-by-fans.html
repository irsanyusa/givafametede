Both Ariana Grande and John Legend each have two artists left.</p><p>Only 10 of the artists will move on after Tuesday night’s results show, with one artist being eliminated.

The song was chosen by Lana’s fans, whom she called “Lanterns.” Her coach Blake Shelton offered “Fanas” as an alternative.</p><p>Lana said she was excited to have the chance to cover a contemporary country song, as that’s the lane she’d like to enter as a music artist. She belted out the fierce song, prompting Ariana Grande to say she felt like she was “at a Lana show,” adding that she’s “never sounded better.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIfFJVH2k84</p></figure><p>Fellow Team Blake star <a href=#>Wendy Moten</a> also delivered a powerhouse performance of “Freeway of Love” by Aretha Franklin. John Legend called her a “flawless vocalist,” pointing out that does things vocally that “almost no one on this planet can do like Wendy can do.” Shelton said she’s already “performing like a legend.”</p><p>Paris Winningham rounded out Shelton’s incredible The Voice team this season with a soulful performance of “Use Me” by Bill Withers. It was fun to watch him connect with the backup singers as he performed. Shelton said he saw Kelly Clarkson stand up three times during the performance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jershika-maple-overcomes-nerves-to-knock-it-out-of-the-park>Jershika Maple Overcomes Nerves to Knock It Out of the Park</h3><p>Another standout performance from Monday night was <a href=#>Jershika Maple’s</a> cover of “How Can I Ease the Pain” by Lisa Fischer. Jershika admitted that she “almost threw up” from nerves before the performance, but you’d never know it from watching her sing.</p><p>Jershika’s coach John Legend encouraged her to draw from her own pain for the emotional performance. Despite the subject matter, Shelton told her, “You made me really happy.” Clarkson, meanwhile, said she’d never even heard the song before, but she’d be downloading it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIOf1ra_uXg</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘HOLLY FORBES DAY’ SET IN ASHLAND, KENTUCKY FOLLOWING HER JOURNEY ON ‘THE VOICE’</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hailey-mia-closes-the-show-with-a-powerful-sia-cover>Hailey Mia Closes the Show with a Powerful Sia Cover</h3><p>The final The Voice performance of the night came from Team Kelly artist Hailey Mia, who sang “Elastic Heart” by Sia. At just 14 years old, Hailey continues to show off a talent beyond her years. She made it through the Instant Save a couple of weeks ago only to be voted into the Top 11 by America last week.</p><p>Hailey delivered an emotional, nuanced performance of the song, wearing a yellow gown while standing in a yellow heart shape on the stage. The crowd went wild for the performance, and the coaches gave her a standing ovation. Shelton said he was so engrossed in the song that it was “hard to see you sad.” Meanwhile, Clarkson predicted that she’ll make the finale of this season.</p><p>If Clarkson doesn’t have an artist in the finale, it’ll be a huge shock. She also has the trio Girl Named Tom, who returned after their <a href=#>hugely popular performance</a> of “Dust in the Wind” to go country with “More Hearts Than Mine” by Ingrid Andress. Meanwhile, Jeremy Rosado performed the Christian song “Reckless Love” by Cory Asbury, and Gymani came back from winning last week’s Instant Save <a href=#>to perform “Diamonds” by Rihanna</a>.</p><p>Let us know in the comments who had your favorite The Voice performance of the night, and remember to vote for your favorites to move on to the Top 10.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NUP_195975_01831.jpg alt="‘The Voice’s Jim Allen Says Performing With Sasha Allen is a ‘Double Dream Come True’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXam1pnnTqKdmaWFivaa%2BxaippmWjpLuov4ycn6irlaN6o8WMn5inq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trump-2024-gop-primary-field.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trump Is Still Dominating the 2024 GOP Primary Field</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./premiers-explorcamps-et-nouveaux-usages-en-bretagne.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Premiers ExplorCamps et nouveaux usages en Bretagne</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
