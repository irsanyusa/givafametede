A Riverside County judge overturned California’s right-to-die law because of a legislative technicality. The California Attorney General has vowed to appeal the ruling.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They’re trying to take away the option of a terminally ill person, like my wife was, to have a peaceful dying process instead of what, in her case, was a brain tumor that would have tortured her to death,” Diaz told TIME on Wednesday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Signed into law in 2015, California’s End of Life Option Act went into effect in June 2016. Within six months, 191 terminally ill people requested medication to end their lives, according <a href=# rel=noopener>to state data;</a> 111 died as a result of the prescribed drugs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before her death, Maynard <a href=# rel=noopener>made a video</a> in which she <a href=#>advocated</a> for legislation like California’s End of Life Option Act. And her husband, Diaz, has pushed for the cause in states around the country ever since.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The hope is that you don’t need to utilize the medication,” Diaz said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“But there are certain cases,” he added, “where these terminally ill individuals are facing a brutal dying process. Just having that option has a lot of relief.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Opponents of the law filed a lawsuit claiming it was unconstitutional. Riverside County Superior Court Judge Daniel A. Ottolia overturned the law on procedural grounds in a ruling Tuesday, taking issue with how the state passed the legislation during a special session focused on healthcare issues. Life Legal Defense Foundation and the American Academy of Medical Ethics – both of which have affiliations with religious groups – led the way in challenging the law.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The court made it clear that assisted suicide has nothing to do with increasing access to health care and that hijacking the special session to advance an unrelated agenda is impermissible,” said Alexandra Snyder, executive director of the Life Legal Defense Foundation, said <a href=# rel=noopener>in a statement Tuesday</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Opponents have also taken issue with the legislation for not requiring a psychological evaluation of patients before they request lethal medication. They also claim the law promotes the wrong message for terminally ill patients who, despite the law’s strict requirements, may be enticed to request the life-ending drugs rather than continue treatment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ruling Tuesday won’t go into effect for four more days, during which California State Attorney General Xavier Becerra can file an appeal. “We strongly disagree with this ruling and the State is seeking expedited review in the Court of Appeal,” the attorney general’s office said in a statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diaz, however, said he feels newly energized to push for legislation in California and elsewhere. He honors his wife by continuing to advocate for aid in dying legislation for terminally ill patients, he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She knew she had this option that the brain tumor could not defeat,” Diaz said. “If the suffering is to a point where, with all medical intervention they’re not able to keep her from suffering, like I said, she has the ability to pass away gently.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If Maynard continued to live with her terminal illness, she likely would have gone blind and lost her ability to speak. “Brittany was simply saying, ‘I will not die that way, and I shouldn’t be forced to,’” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her story incited more awareness for <a href=#>the Death With Dignity movement</a>, which began in Oregon when a group of physicians helped pass the first statewide law that allowed for terminally ill patients to request drugs to end their lives.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The legislation in California features a number of requirements terminally ill patients must meet to the satisfaction of two separate physicians. The patient must have a diagnosis of death in less than six months, and must voluntarily request the lethal drugs themselves, among other stipulations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the overturning of the California law disappointed Diaz, he said he is optimistic more states will enact legislation moving forward. And with the likely appeal from the state attorney general, his fight for California’s medicine aid in dying legislation is not over.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This truly is an option,” he said. “If a person has decided on their own to apply for and qualify for the prescription, then you get to focus on living life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamduhnd%2Bjpupoqyklru6ecyasKeZopl6qcHSm5innF2Yrq21xaipp6GRYr%2Bqs8etZK2nXZm2pnnLmq5mp6aav7XB0aecnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dans-les-qpv-les-equipements-sportifs-sont-proches-mais-peu-varies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dans les QPV, les quipements sportifs sont proches mais peu varis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1493281-15-celebrities-accurately-predicted-deaths.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 celebrities that accurately predicted their own deaths</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
