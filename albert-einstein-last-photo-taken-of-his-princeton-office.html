No scientist has been more famous, no antiwar activist ever argued his case with more conviction, no exemplar of genius has ever been as frequently invoked (albeit in language often dripping with sarcasm: “Nice going, Einstein!”) than the German-born father of modern physics. So when word came on a Monday morning in April 1955 that Einstein had died, at age 76, at New Jersey’s Princeton Hospital, the victim of an aortic aneurysm, the scramble was on to recount the story of his life and, as urgently, his death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">LIFE photographer <a href=# rel=noopener>Ralph Morse</a> was among scores of journalists who descended on Princeton, hoping to find and report on something, anything, that might offer insight into what Einstein’s passing meant to his friends, family and peers, as well as to countless strangers around the world who, for myriad reasons, felt a kinship with the man.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No one but Morse, however, finagled his way into Einstein’s office that day. No one but Morse came away with a photograph that, six decades later, serves as a haunting reflection of both the man and his life’s work: a seemingly simple picture of Einstein’s desk, cluttered with notebooks, journals, a pipe, a tobacco tin; behind the desk a blackboard covered with equations and formulas that, to the untrained eye, possess an almost runic power.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>[Buy the TIME book, Albert Einstein: The Enduring Legacy of a Modern Genius]</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The story of how Morse got the picture, meanwhile, is an object lesson in tenacity and a reminder of the invaluable skill of thinking on one’s feet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After getting a call that April morning from a LIFE editor telling him that Einstein had died, Morse jumped into his car and sped from his house in northern New Jersey to Princeton.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I headed to the hospital first,” Morse tells LIFE.com, “but it was chaos — journalists, photographers, onlookers. So I headed over to Einstein’s office [at the Institute for Advanced Study]. On the way, I stopped and bought a case of scotch. I knew people might be reluctant to talk but that they’re usually happy to accept a bottle of booze, rather than money, in exchange for their help. Anyway, I get to the building, find the superintendent, offer him a fifth of scotch and like that, he opens up the office.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The rest, in a very real sense, is history. Morse took a few pictures in the office and more throughout the day as he tried (successfully, it turned out) to track down where Einstein’s funeral service was taking place. But ultimately it was the portrait of the desk, the chair, the bookshelves and the blackboard that resonated. LIFE magazine published the photograph above a headline that, one suspects, would have made the theoretical physicist himself smile: “His Fourth Dimension, Time, Overtakes Einstein.”</p><figure class=text-left readability=31.5><p>The empty chair by the formula-filled blackboard [LIFE wrote] looked as if the scholar who usually sat in it had merely stepped away, perhaps to gaze reflectively at the meadow which rolls past the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. But the chair would not again be filled. Last week the entire world went into mourning for the greatest scientific thinker of his age. . . . For 50 years the world had been heaping honors on him, but Einstein remained indifferent to worldly glory. Dressing in baggy old clothes, he shut himself away in lonely contemplation of the massive intellectual problems he alone could solve. But he emerged to champion the ideals he cherished: justice, freedom, peace. He believed in his own form of “cosmic” religion. “I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil,” he said. “The presence of a superior reasoning power, revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Morse’s photo of Einstein’s comfortably disheveled desk, his burdened bookshelves, his soaring thoughts rendered on a blackboard in the universal language of mathematics, we glimpse both the essence and the solid, tangible shape of one of the 20th century’s signature lives: Here, the picture says, is where Einstein worked, dreamed, lived his singular, principled life to its fullest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Few pictures have managed to convey, in one frame, so much about an imagination and intellect that traveled so far, for so long, in such rarefied realms.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>[MORE: See the gallery, “The Day Einstein Died: A Photographer’s Story”]</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ben Cosgrove is the Editor of LIFE.com</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0011511101.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZscGdufXh8jpqjm52iqXqmtc2sq56hnmK5or%2FTZqehp6SkerWtyp6lZqeWYrWqv4ypqaKmk5rBsLqMqJ2foZOafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbie-cut-scene-greta-gerwig-refused-remove-old-woman-bench-scene-1235676474.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barbie Cut Scene: Greta Gerwig Refused to Remove Old Woman Bench Scene</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ken-jennings-the-man-who-broke-records-by-winning-74-games-and-dollar25-million-on.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The man who broke records by winning 74 games and $2.5 million on 'Jeopardy' says everyone gets the</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
