The fact that he is all of these things—and a man of tact and horse sense, too—goes a long way to explain the rise of Southern Methodist University. Last week, already the biggest private university in the Southwest and still sprouting, S.M.U. proudly dedicated its newest shining wonder: a $3,500,000 school of theology, consisting of seven pink brick, Georgian-style buildings spread on 16 acres of the S.M.U. campus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As usual, President Lee disclaimed credit. This time the credit went to Joe J. Perkins, multimillionaire merchant and oilman of Wichita Falls, and his wife Lois. The Perkinses had put up $2,500,000 toward the new theology school and, better yet, had handed the school a thoughtful endowment: 50 going oil wells in east Texas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Domes & Dormers. S.M.U. has trebled in enrollment (to 7,250) and assets (to $24 million) since Umphrey Lee took over in 1939. In those days the 133-acre S.M.U. campus, just north of Dallas, had twelve buildings. Now it sparkles with the gold domes, white dormers and tall steeples of 28. Umphrey Lee (who explains the Umphrey by saying, “Some of my ancestors just couldn’t spell”) thinks that he raised maybe $6,000 toward all this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is truth and good sense in Lee’s attitude. Building schools is a passion with Texans,* and nearly every college in the state has construction either under way or blueprinted. As Umphrey puts it: “There is an atmosphere of achievement and a healthy attitude toward giving. People do not ask, ‘Can it be done?’ They know it can. All they want to know is whether it is desirable.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lee admires Texas and Texans all right, but the admiration is mutual. At 57, he symbolizes the practical, constructive faith of the state and the Southwest in general. Indiana-born, he moved to Texas in time to be one of the first students S.M.U. had. He took an M.A. in history there in 1916, then went to Columbia and Union Theological Seminary for more study. Eventually, out of all this came an analytical study of Methodist John Wesley—The Lord’s Horseman, Lee called him. Out of it came also a desire to get back to Texas. His first jobs back home were pastorates in several small Texas towns; later came the pastorate of the big Highland Park Methodist Church in Dallas, Finally the presidency of S.M.U.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thought & Belief. Nowadays, pretty close to being the recognized No. 1 citizen of Dallas, Umphrey Lee is a busy man. He belongs to such potent organizations as the Citizens’ Council, the organization of businessmen without whom nothing can be done in Dallas, and the ultra-select Thirteen Club, a group of 13 who get together periodically to hash over world and local problems. Nonsmoking, nondrinking, Lee has no advice to thrust on those who do. He likes to tell of one friend who drinks deeply and then often calls Lee up to tell him what’s wrong with S.M.U. Football is another thing that President Lee takes in stride. It does not worry him overmuch that S.M.U. consistently has one of the best football teams in the U.S. Texas likes good football, and so does Umphrey Lee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But all this, in Lee’s mind, is secondary to “the main business” of S.M.U.: teaching students to think. And, says he, “the older I get, the surer I am that it is not only important to know how to think, but that it is important to know what to think about.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“No higher education, professional or otherwise, can afford to neglect philosophy, literature and religion. In a country as practical as the Southwest, one would think the public would demand only the scientific and the practical. For some reason, a considerable portion of the Southwest thinks that there is no harm in believing something.” No thunderer, no John Wesley, Umphrey Lee stops short of telling Texans exactly what to believe. His sermons are built with brick and stone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">*Not new. In the 1840s, an English traveler visited a Texas frontier community, sardonically recorded in his journal that “they have built two colleges and have logs cut for a university.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tam5ma4JwscOumpqsmaS7brrEsJysrF2otaq6yKeeZq%2Bfo7Gmvo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./future-nayvadius-wilburn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Future [Nayvadius Wilburn] (Rapper) - On This Day</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1584915-i-asked-3-milky-doughnuts-lady-leaks-hot-voice-note-lover-making-request.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;I Only Asked Him for 3 Milky Doughnuts&amp;quot;: Lady Leaks Hot Voice Note from Lover after Making Request</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
