Let’s take a deep dive and find out some couples that first got their start on talent shows and some updates on whether or not they’re still together today.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-gabby-barrett-and-cade-foehner-met-on-american-idol>1. Gabby Barrett And Cade Foehner Met On ‘American Idol’</h2><p>Gabby Barrett and Cade Foehner met while competing on season 16 of American Idol. Cade was eliminated in the top five while Gabby finished in third place. Gabby has said that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>she actually made the first move</a> to talk to Cade during their time on American Idol. The two began texting and immediately hit it off. The pair began dating seriously and got engaged in March of 2019. They wasted no time as they were married in October of that same year. The pair celebrated the success of Gabby’s hit single “I Hope” and landed her the first career No.1 on the country charts of her career.</p><p>They also welcomed a daughter Baylah May in January 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-maddie-poppe-and-caleb-lee-hutchinson-also-met-on-idol>2. Maddie Poppe And Caleb Lee Hutchinson Also Met On ‘Idol’</h3><p>In yet another one of the most iconic relationships to come out of the same season of American Idol, of course, we have to talk about Maddie Poppe and Caleb Lee Hutchinson. Both of them had tons of success on the show but their relationship started to form after they were placed in the same group during the iconic Hollywood Week. During the season finale of the show, they revealed to the world that they were in fact a couple and they ended up being the top two, with Maddie going on to win the show. The pair are still currently dating and Maddie even said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she is ready to marry Caleb.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9OUpP-HjHP/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-catie-turner-and-zach-d-onofrio-were-another-idol-couple>3. Catie Turner And Zach D’Onofrio Were Another ‘Idol’ Couple</h3><p>Catie Turner and Zach D’Onofrio were probably two of the most genuine contestants to ever grace the American Idol stage. They both were super quirky and nerdy and started off gushing over each other during Hollywood Week. Catie liked Zach’s voice and style and they had some unforgettable interactions that made viewers smile as the adorable relationship began to take form. When Zach was cut during Hollywood Week, Catie was devastated.</p><p>She joined him for his Season 19 American Idol audition this year to announce to viewers that they were a couple. However, it appears recently that they broke up and have unfollowed each other on Instagram.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-kelly-clarkson-and-justin-guarini-are-the-original-idol-couple>4. Kelly Clarkson And Justin Guarini Are The Original ‘Idol’ Couple</h3><p>Ok, so there were tons of rumors swirling during season one of American Idol that Kelly Clarkson and runner up Justin Guarini were an item. They had genuine chemistry and witty banter on the show before going on to star in the steamy movie From Justin To Kelly in 2003. Eventually, everyone’s curiosity about the pair was answered as both of them admitted that they did in fact have a fling but it did not happen until after American Idol. It was short-lived after <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Kelly’s career really began to take off </a>and she became one of the most successful artists of all time. So while this isn’t a full-blown talent show relationship, it was still blossomed because of American Idol.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>IS KELLY CLARKSON’S EMOTIONAL COVER A MESSAGE TO EX-HUSBAND BRANDON BLACKSTOCK?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-colton-swon-and-caroline-glaser-met-on-the-voice>5. Colton Swon And Caroline Glaser Met On ‘The Voice’</h3><p>Colton Swon and Caroline Glaser both turned chairs on season four of The Voice in 2013. They immediately hit it off and started dating. Colton was part of the group The Swon Brothers and made it all the way to third place on the show. They were the first duo to ever make it past the top 12. The Swon Brothers eventually went on tour with American Idol winner Carrie Underwood. After four years of dating, Colton proposed in 2017 and they were married a year later. You need to see their adorable wedding video below, it’s full of tears and laughter and will genuinely make you smile.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-chloe-jasmine-and-stevi-richie-were-an-x-factor-couple>6. Chloe Jasmine And Stevi Richie Were An ‘X Factor’ Couple</h3><p>Chloe Jasmine and Stevi Richie met in 2014 on The X Factor and rumors began swirling immediately that the pair were together. She placed 13th on the show while Stevi placed 6th. After some PDA filled photos surfaced, the couple finally confirmed their relationship. Chloe and Stevi announced their engagement in 2015 but their family had their doubts. Minutes before getting married, the pair called off the wedding. Chloe’s family felt like Stevi would not be able to support the couple nor build a career to keep them afloat. Plus, Stevi still lived at home. Instead of a wedding, they had a yacht blessing. However, the pair have been very public about having an on-again-off-again relationship. They haven’t posted together on social media since 2018. We assume they secretly called it quits since Stevi posted a picture on Valentine’s day with another woman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-nicole-scherzinger-and-thom-evans-also-met-on-the-x-factor>7. <strong>Nicole Scherzinger and Thom Evans</strong> Also Met On ‘The X Factor’</h3><p>In a bit of a more scandalous relationship, we have a case of a judge dating a former contestant. Granted, the pair met on the celebrity version of The X Factor, but Nicole Scherzinger started dating rugby player Thom Evans after fancying him on the show. Thom was a part of the singing group Try Star on the show and Nicole immediately had her eye on him. On regular seasons of the show, the judges must sign a contract that says they will not pursue romantic relationships with contestants. Perhaps there was no such contract on this edition of the show. The pair went public with their relationship in early 2020 and have been professing their love for each other on social media ever since. Thom also has been showing off his knack for singing and sang a duet with Nicole for his birthday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-iEwnhDHqR/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-cheryl-and-liam-payne-met-on-the-x-factor>8. Cheryl And Liam Payne Met On ‘The X Factor’</h3><p>Liam Payne auditioned for The X Factor twice, the second time marking his start with the group One Direction in 2010. There was always a mild flirtation between the two, but Liam was just a teenager at the time which made it one of the more controversial talent show relationships. The pair first went public with their relationship in late 2015 after years of creating buzz and rumors each time they would hang out in the public eye. In 2016, Liam posted a Valentine’s Day tribute to Cheryl that set the internet into a frenzy. In 2017, after Cheryl put her baby bump on display, the pair welcomed their son, Bear. But they did experience a lot of turmoil in their relationship and were on-again and off-again. In June of 2018, they announced that they had split after two and a half years together but they continue to co-parent their son.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-simon-cowell-and-danni-minogue-met-on-the-x-factor>9. Simon Cowell And Danni Minogue Met On ‘The X Factor’</h3><p>Simon Cowell is no stranger to having flings. He hit it off with fellow&nbsp;judge Dannii Minogue who he had a massive crush on immediately when he saw her in 2007. Simon later confessed that the two had a very brief love affair “I had a crush on her. It was Dannii’s hair, the sexy clothes, and the t**s. I was like a schoolboy. She was foxy. She was a real man’s girl. Very feminine. It was genuine love”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>he said in an interview.</a>&nbsp;It was also very short-lived as they both moved on from their fling that was only a few weeks long. Check out a deeper look at Simon’s love life below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A TIMELINE OF SIMON COWELL’S DATING HISTORY: RELATIONSHIPS, AFFAIRS, ENGAGEMENTS AND HOOKUPS</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-are-the-ultimate-voice-couple>10. Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani Are The Ultimate ‘Voice’ Couple</h3><p>Though they weren’t contestants on The Voice, they met while they were coaches in 2014. They both got divorced in 2015 and officially started dating becoming one of the most iconic talent show relationships of all time. Blake Shelton has built a great relationship with Gwen Stefani’s sons over the years and the pair have always gushed about each other on social media and talk shows. Engagement rumors and questions about whether or not the pair will get married anytime soon have always been a factor in their relationship. Blake finally popped the question in 2020 and fans are eager to see when the pair will walk down the aisle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>GWEN STEFANI SUMS UP BLAKE SHELTON’S DADDY SKILLS IN 8 PHOTOS</a></strong></p><p>Are any of your favorite talent show relationships missing from this list?
