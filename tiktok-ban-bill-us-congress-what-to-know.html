The House approved the same bill 360-58 on April 20.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The House previously passed a bipartisan TikTok ban bill that had a six-month selling deadline in March, but the legislation hadn’t come to a vote in the Senate yet. Combining a TikTok measure in the foreign aid package fast-tracked its passage.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After signing the package into law, Biden <a href=#>gave an address</a> that focused on Ukraine and Israel, but did not mention TikTok by name. “This is consequential,” he said about the entire package, vowing that the legislation as a whole would make America safer.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew <a href=#>posted a message</a> on the platform Wednesday decrying the law that he said “is designed to ban TikTok in the United States.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That will take TikTok away from you and 170 million Americans who find community and connection on our platform. Make no mistake, this is a ban––a ban on TikTok and a ban on you and your voice,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chew implied that the company would sue over the new law.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Rest assured, we aren’t going anywhere,” he continued. “We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts. The facts and the Constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail again.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TIME has reached out to TikTok for further comment.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The new law comes at an interesting time. In February<a href=#>,</a> <a href=#>Biden’s 2024 campaign joined TikTok</a> in an apparent attempt to connect with younger voters. Former President Donald Trump has said that he <a href=#>does not support</a> a TikTok ban, calling the app a national security risk but arguing that a potential ban could make Facebook more powerful.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what you need to know about the new law that could ban TikTok.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What does the new TikTok law say?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The proposed TikTok ban was part of a bill, one among the package signed into law, called <a href=#>the “21st Century Peace through Strength Act”</a> that also puts more sanctions on Russia and Iran. The bill prohibits a “foreign adversary controlled application” within U.S. borders, defining that as anything operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance, TikTok or a subsidiary.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TikTok will now have 270 days (around nine months) to sell, which Biden could extend by 90 days if there’s progress toward a sale.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How does the new TikTok law differ from the first proposed ban?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first bill that proposed banning TikTok, called “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” was introduced in the House on Mar. 5 by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL). Pressure to regulate TikTok has been mounting in the last year since<a href=#> FBI Director Christopher Wray testified</a> before Congress that the app is a tool of the Chinese government and “screams out with national security concerns.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawmakers worry that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use TikTok as a tool to help influence the democratic processes of the U.S., either by showing and promoting content that supports its agendas or collecting data on its American users.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is my message to TikTok: Break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,” said Chairman Gallagher on Mar. 5,<a href=#> in a press release</a> regarding the bill.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“So long as it is owned by ByteDance and thus required to collaborate with the CCP, TikTok poses critical threats to our national security,” added Rep. Krishnamoorthi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>TikTok has denied</a> having ties to the CCP.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We have invested to keep your data safe and our platform free from outside manipulation. We have committed that we would continue to do so,” Chew said in a response <a href=#>video</a> to the House vote on the first bill, calling the outcome“disappointing.” Chew also mentioned that the bill would give power to other social media companies outside of TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The House passed the initial TikTok bill 352-65 in March.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During discussions on the House floor on April 20, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who put forth the new bill that includes the TikTok ban, said “this bill also protects Americans––especially our children––from the malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party-controlled TikTok.” He later said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was “very pleased” after its passage: “We must stand strong in the face of aggression; our adversaries are watching us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Chew’s video following the bill being signed into law, the CEO vowed to continue to invest and innovate to keep the platform safe. He said through U.S. data security efforts, the company has built safeguards “that no other peer company has made.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We have invested billions of dollars to secure your data and keep our platform free from outside manipulation,” he said.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What will happen now?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 270-day clock starts now. ByteDance must either sell the platform or face a ban. If they don’t, they can be fined with a civil penalty of $5,000 multiplied by the number of users in the U.S., the new law says. (TikTok <a href=#>said</a> on X on April 17 that the ban would impact 170 million Americans).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chew’s statements imply that the company will fight the decision. The bill says an entity can challenge the law in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit no later than 165 days after the act is enacted.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How has TikTok responded?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In his most recent video message, Chew argued that TikTok gives everyday people the freedom of expression that reflects American values. He also said TikTok is home to seven million business owners who have built livelihoods on the platform.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">‘It’s obviously a disappointing moment, but it does not need to be a defining one,” he said of the potential ban.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ahead of the bill’s passage, TikTok <a href=#>posted on X on April 18</a> a criticism of the legislation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,” the post read.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TikTok has responded by notifying all of its users with an advertisement urging them to call their congressional representatives to express their discontent with the legislation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Congress is planning a total ban of TikTok,”<a href=#> the app informs users</a>. “This will damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country, and deny artists an audience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TikTok CEO Chew has visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill to argue against the legislation. In a <a href=#>video</a> shared on the social media platform, he said that the ban would put more than 300,000 American jobs at risk. Chew also encouraged people to speak out against the ban, and make their “voices heard."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcGlthXWBjq2gpKyfoHqjrc1mmaKknGLCtHnCqKWgqpWowG7Dx5qrZqyfYrivu9Zo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./winners-and-losers-in-new-hampshire-presidential-primary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Winners and Losers in New Hampshire's Presidential Primary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./transition-energetique-les-points-du-projet-de-loi-qui-font-encore-debat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les points du projet de loi qui font (encore) dbat</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
