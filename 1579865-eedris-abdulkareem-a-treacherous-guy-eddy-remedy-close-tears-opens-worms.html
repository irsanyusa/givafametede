According to the veteran singer, the rapper has proven himself to be a treacherous person driven by greed.</p>“I don’t know where Eedris’ story came from; that boy is a greedy boy; he has always been greedy right from time, and he’s calling me the greedy one, can you imagine? I’m the one that formed the group o, I’m the one that invited him into the group. He said he was coming on a Monday morning, and he brought Tony (Tetuila); I had never met Tony in my life; I just saw a guy limping behind him. When they got to my room I asked who he was he then introduced Tony to me, and that was when Eedris was supposed to tell me that ‘this guy, his parents have given me some money before, that I should move with him and take him everywhere I’m going’, he didn’t tell me that. I’m mentioning this now because that was where the rumours started when we were on the Shakomo tour; the rumour started that Tony’s parents were sponsoring the group, no. I had $5000 that my parents sent me from America to get out of the country and come to them since I had graduated. I refused to travel, and I used that money to sponsor the group throughout that time,” he said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4fdc5dbf4787ccaa.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Burna Boy calls himself odogwu but he’s a man child”: OAP blasts Grammy winner for shading Davido</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Eddy went on to explain how much he suffered to form the D’Remedies group and all the things he went through to even write Shakomo because he was still in school at the time and had issues with cultists who also wanted in on the song.</p><p class=align-left>He narrated how Eedris Abdulkareem took his song, Shakomo, and went behind him to meet one Omololu, claiming he was the owner of the song but he needed a singer on it.</p>“God knows how much I suffered to put this group together back then, God knows how much I suffered to even write Shakomo because I was in school and going through a lot with frats who wanted me to mention their name when performing Shakomo, I was popular already with Shakomo so I don’t know where Eedris is bringing this story from.
