Many voters – particularly those that switched to Labour – say that <a href=#>addressing the cost of living should be one of the main priorities for the new government</a>.</p><p data-block-key=339os>This is hardly surprising – only one in ten Britons (10%) currently believe that the economy is in a good state, with nearly two-thirds (64%) thinking it is in a bad state, including one in six (17%) viewing ‘very bad’ as the most apt description. Only one in five Britons (21%) say they have both been able to maintain their pre-cost-of-living crisis spending levels and will continue to be able to do so, compared to 55% who say they have had to make cuts and 18% who say they expect to.</p><p data-block-key=a4lgg>The public’s optimism on the economy could, though, be about to turn a corner. While there has not exactly been a surge in optimism, 27% say they expect the economy to improve over the next year and 29% expecting it worsen. This represents the strongest net economic optimism score (-2) in the last two years and a clear improvement on the net score of -16 shortly before the election, when only 19% expected the economy to get better and 35% anticipated a worsening situation in the year ahead.</p><p data-block-key=1pgen>There is a clear partisan component to this swing, suggesting the election outcome is playing a role in the public’s improved outlook. At the very start of July, 30% of those intending to vote Conservative and just 26% of Labour supporters expected the economy to get better over the next twelve months. A week after the election only 15% of those who voted Conservative still anticipated things picking up by this time next year, with half (49%) of Labour voters now believing economic conditions will improve. Lib Dem supporters have similarly seen a surge in optimism (‘get better’ doubling to 36%), while Reform UK voters remain pessimistic (an unchanged figure of only 12% expecting an improvement).</p><p data-block-key=1f6a2>Nonetheless, though the jump in the last few weeks has been bigger than usual, it does follow a broader trend. The number expecting the economy to get worse had already reduced from 48% last August to 35% at the start of July, with those expecting an improvement growing from 15% to 19% over the same period.</p><p data-block-key=1sad>The boost in national economic optimism, has not translated to a substantive increase in the number expecting their own household financial situation to improve over the next year. Only one in six Britons (16%) believe their circumstances will improve, while 44% expect them to remain steady and 31% think they will get worse – these figures are all almost identical to our immediate pre-election polling.</p><p data-block-key=cgmsb><b>See the full results </b><a href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=24hkm>How do you feel about your household finances, the economy in general, and everything else?
