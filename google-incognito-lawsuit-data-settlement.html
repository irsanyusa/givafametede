While that function lets users turn off data collection when using the Chrome browser, other Google tools&nbsp;used by websites, such as advertising technology, scoop up their data anyway, according to the suit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Google, which&nbsp;agreed to settle in December, will expunge&nbsp;“billions” of data records that reflect people’s private browsing, according&nbsp;to details that were made public Monday in a filing at San Francisco federal court. Google also said it made several changes to its disclosures to clarify how people’s data is collected as well as&nbsp;what activity is visible to websites when users browse in “incognito” mode. And the company agreed for the next five years to allow incognito mode users to block third-party cookies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was meritless,”&nbsp;Jose Castaneda,&nbsp;Google spokesperson, said in a statement. “We never associate data with users when they use incognito mode. We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the plaintiffs asked for $5 billion in damages, the settlement includes no payment from Google. Instead, individuals will be able to pursue damages by filing their own complaints against Google in U.S. state courts, according to court papers. About 50 people have already done so, plaintiffs’ lawyers said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The plaintiffs’ lawyers, led by attorney David Boies, called the settlement “groundbreaking” and a “historic step” in requiring big tech companies to be transparent to users about how they collect and use their data. Google’s agreement to retroactively delete user information is a significant concession as it forms the backbone of the company’s lucrative advertising business, which depends on the quality of its search engine. It also comes as Google is in the throes of multiple regulatory challenges in the U.S. and abroad, amid rising concerns about how the tech giants use the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vast amounts of data</a> they collect from users.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Which Apps Collect My Personal Data and Should I Worry?</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There has been a steady drumbeat of complaints, lawsuits, and regulatory action centered on companies collecting or sharing customer data in unexpected ways,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie Liu</a>, a senior&nbsp;analyst at&nbsp;Forrester. “The rise of privacy-oriented class action lawsuits and complaints shows consumers are increasingly privacy savvy and taking action."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The settlement provides “substantial relief” for plaintiffs, according to representatives of the consumers in the lawsuit, which include attorneys from the law firms Boies Schiller Flexner and Morgan & Morgan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Google Will Stop Providing Law Enforcement Data on Which Users Were Near a Crime</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The settlement also forestalled a trial that was scheduled for February, in a year that’s expected to be one of Google’s busiest in the courts. A jury trial in a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general accusing the company of violating antitrust regulations by illegally monopolizing digital advertising is slated for September, and a similar lawsuit from Texas and other states challenging its ad tech practices has been scheduled for March 2025.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Why We Should Get Paid for Our Online Data</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a third case, a U.S. judge in Washington is set to hear closing arguments in May for a landmark federal antitrust trial that alleges the company has illegally monopolized the online search market.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZngnN9jqCmqJ%2BcmnqqusKonqehpKR6ra3WrKyirF2ZrrWtjKycraycmrqmutNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1433572-hillary-vaughns-biography-age-measurements-married-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hillary Vaughns biography: age, measurements, is she married</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tva-en-compensation-de-la-cvae-supprimee-une-bonne-affaire-pour-les-regions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>une bonne affaire pour les rgions ?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
