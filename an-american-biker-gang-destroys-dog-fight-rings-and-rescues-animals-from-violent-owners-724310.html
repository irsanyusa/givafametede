They investigated cases of&nbsp;animal abuse, came to&nbsp;really violent owners and convinced them to&nbsp;give their pets away. The men made agreements with animal shelters, have helped animals with rehabilitation, and found new families for cats, dogs, and horses.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> looked into the activities of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Rescue Ink</a> organization and was amazed at&nbsp;how they managed to&nbsp;take away animals from cruel owners when the police were helpless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/895/da8/61c31755ff9d1b94b79ffb0cf5.jpg><p>Rescue Ink is&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-profit animal rights protection organization that originated from a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;volunteers in&nbsp;New York. The team <a href=#>consists</a> of&nbsp;bikers, ex-bodybuilders, powerlifting champions, former military personnel, police detectives, and lawyers. The team was at&nbsp;its peak of&nbsp;activity from 2008 to&nbsp;2014.</p><p>“Some people like to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;us as&nbsp;superheroes. The truth&nbsp;is, we&nbsp;are super animal lovers (and protectors). Through the years, and through many caseloads, obstacles, and downright challenges, we&nbsp;remain strong and dedicated to&nbsp;our mission.”</p><p>Rescue Ink cooperated with the police and public organizations. They did all they could within the boundaries of&nbsp;the law to&nbsp;protect animals from abuse. Their work depended fully on&nbsp;donations.</p><p>Tom Hardy wearing a&nbsp;Rescue Ink T-shirt</p><p>The team <a href=#>received</a> about 1,000 to&nbsp;3,000 messages per day via e-mail alone from different people all around the world and about 250 calls per day.</p><p>During the years of&nbsp;their activity, they saved a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;dogs, cats, horses, chickens, pigs, and fish. And once, they even saved a&nbsp;5-ft boa constrictor.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview for <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, the bikers said that they were in&nbsp;very different situations: some people sold purebred dogs just because they needed money for drugs, other people organized dog fights, and some even tried to&nbsp;poison a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;homeless cats not far from their house. Once, they had a&nbsp;report about a&nbsp;serial cat killer from Pennsylvania.</p><p>And here is&nbsp;something important you should know: the team only investigated the cases of&nbsp;animal abuse: if&nbsp;they managed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;criminal, Rescue Ink contacted the police. If&nbsp;an&nbsp;animal owner didn’t take good care of&nbsp;the pet, the bikers would build a&nbsp;<a href=#>dog house</a> or&nbsp;help in&nbsp;some other way.</p><p>With their work, the bikers proved that all of&nbsp;them have big, kind hearts. One of&nbsp;the participants of&nbsp;Rescue Ink spent 1.5 weeks carrying a&nbsp;small kitten with him everywhere because he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;feed him every few hours. Another biker once got into a&nbsp;pond near a&nbsp;sewer in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;duck.</p><p>The Rescue Ink participants spent years teaching adults and children to&nbsp;make them realize that animal abuse is&nbsp;wrong and dangerous.</p><p>Most of&nbsp;the time, <a href=#>abusers</a> are people who have similar features: they are insecure, impulsive and ruthless because they have problems at&nbsp;home or&nbsp;in&nbsp;their relationships.</p><p>Bikers <a href=#>believe</a> that animal abuse is&nbsp;just the first step for such people. Later, because they feel like they can’t be&nbsp;punished, they become more secure and they can abuse someone else like a&nbsp;child, a&nbsp;woman, or&nbsp;an&nbsp;elderly person. This is&nbsp;why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;important to&nbsp;prevent all cases of&nbsp;animal abuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6ad/047/f2d45b58338d807fa3ce22542a.png><p>Sometimes, bikers had to&nbsp;save pets whose owners died and nobody else cared about them. In&nbsp;such cases, the bikers contacted shelters and took the animals there on&nbsp;their own. At&nbsp;some point, they set up&nbsp;their own shelter but it&nbsp;was damaged during a&nbsp;hurricane.</p><p>The 2&nbsp;photos below were taken near the shelter and you can watch a&nbsp;video about the shelter <a href=#>here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/597/200/b949ed53969fc50d5a0f30c4b7.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4a0/a2c/102d81528286bcf0cdac60d159.png><p>Some animals needed rehabilitation. For example, some owners played with a&nbsp;small puppy and stopped taking care of&nbsp;it&nbsp;when he&nbsp;grew&nbsp;up. The poor dog was forced to&nbsp;sleep outside in&nbsp;any weather until the guys from Rescue Ink convinced the owners to&nbsp;<a href=#>give the dog away</a>.</p><p>Some dogs are exploited for breeding and are sold as&nbsp;expensive purebred puppies. In&nbsp;this case, people contacted Rescue Ink when they heard strange sounds or&nbsp;sensed strange smells but never saw a&nbsp;dog walking or&nbsp;noticed that a&nbsp;dog was hungry and exhausted.</p><p>The bikers visited such owners and talked to&nbsp;them. If&nbsp;the owner didn’t want to&nbsp;agree, they called the police. Most of&nbsp;the time, animals were rescued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/260/b21/f74dcb569783c9af8b89c1c054.jpg><p>Rescue Ink is&nbsp;adopting a&nbsp;dog named Lola.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with People, the team explained that their appearance is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge advantage when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;negotiating with cruel owners.</p><p>They could approach an&nbsp;abuser much closer than the police could. Their intimidating look was their way to&nbsp;help the animals that really needed&nbsp;it.</p><p>“Let’s just say an&nbsp;official goes to&nbsp;an&nbsp;abuser’s house, he&nbsp;pulls up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cop car and, immediately the abuser knows the cop’s limitations, he&nbsp;has certain boundaries. But when we&nbsp;pull&nbsp;up, they don’t know what we’re going to&nbsp;do, they don’t know what we’re capable of&nbsp;doing. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;helps out big time.”</p><p>The team members changed several times: some people left and some people joined. Here are some of&nbsp;the participants:</p><p>1. Batso Maccharoli is&nbsp;the powerlifting record-holder in&nbsp;Connecticut, US. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most recognizable members of&nbsp;the team. In&nbsp;the 2009&nbsp;picture, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;76&nbsp;years old. Now, it’s 2019, and he&nbsp;still has an&nbsp;active lifestyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c0/444/039d2f5cefb791a83b8cd8b977.jpg><p>2. Mikey Ink is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bodybuilding champion and vegetarian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/023/c62/77247a5d7682286ee40f2f41f7.jpg><p>3. Anthony “Big Ant” Rossano is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who is&nbsp;6’1″ tall and who weighs 324&nbsp;lb. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;definitely a&nbsp;person who can convince someone with just his appearance. The pit bulls, cats, and rabbits he&nbsp;saved <a href=#>live</a> in&nbsp;his house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a29/06a/866cbb5ab7a9ced98fc418d756.jpg><p>4. Joe Panz is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the founders and the leader of&nbsp;Rescue Ink.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;book about every little and big accomplishment that Rescue Ink has made. It’s called <a href=#>Rescue Ink</a>: How Ten Guys Saved Countless Dogs and Cats, Twelve Horses, Five Pigs, One Duck, and a&nbsp;Few Turtles.</p><p>The <a href=#>National Geographic</a> channel made a&nbsp;whole reality show called, Rescue Ink Unleashed. These 2&nbsp;photos are of&nbsp;the guests getting temporary tattoos when the show was released.</p><p>Every year, about 10,000 <a href=#>dogs</a> die as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;illegally organized fights. Every day, there are reports of&nbsp;animal abuse and it’s not just direct physical abuse but also indifference of&nbsp;owners to&nbsp;the animal’s needs. Such organizations like Rescue Ink give hope for building a&nbsp;happier world.</p><p>What is&nbsp;the situation with animal rights and protection in&nbsp;your city?
