Sandra Layne walks up and shoots him again. This time in the stomach,' Paul Walton, Oakland County's chief assistant prosecutor, said during his opening statement today.</p><p>Defense attorney Jerome Sabbota countered that the diminutive Layne feared for her safety during the fatal confrontation in the West Bloomfield Township condo that Hoffman shared with his grandparents.</p><p>An autopsy revealed Hoffman was shot three times in the chest, once in the abdomen and once in his left arm. Tests showed the teen had traces of synthetic marijuana in his body.</p><p>Officers had been called to the home northwest of Detroit about two months earlier, when Layne told police she was having a difficult time because her grandson was very upset and yelling. No arrests were made that day.</p><p>Four days before that, the alternative high school senior was pulled over in nearby Farmington Hills and ticketed for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.&nbsp;</p><p>A few minutes later, he tells the operator: 'I got shot, shot again. Please help. Help,' before his voice trails off and a woman's shouts are heard in the background.</p><p>An officer testified at Layne's preliminary examination that when police arrived, she walked out of her home with her hands up and screamed: 'I murdered my grandson.'</p><p>A Glock 9mm semiautomatic handgun was found just inside the front door. Nine spent cartridge cases also were found in the house.</p><p>Sabbota said Layne is expected to take the stand during the trial.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3eAlm9loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./every-reference-taylor-swift.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Every Reference in Taylor Swift's New Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-victoria-beckham-never-smiles-in-pictures-818622.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Victoria Beckham Never Smiles in Pictures</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
