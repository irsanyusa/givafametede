The film told the story of&nbsp;the rebel aviator Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. As&nbsp;you know, it&nbsp;became an&nbsp;instant classic thanks to&nbsp;its revolutionary aerial acrobatics and the charismatic cast. This was the movie that launched <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a> to&nbsp;worldwide fame, and others too.</p><p>This may come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise to&nbsp;you, but the movie is&nbsp;36&nbsp;years old now! Now that a&nbsp;sequel is&nbsp;soon to&nbsp;be&nbsp;released, we&nbsp;wondered what has become of&nbsp;the cast of&nbsp;this classic, so&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> prepared this article for you to&nbsp;know.</p><p><h2>1. Pete “Maverick” Mitchell&nbsp;— Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e4/49a/0a6ac45923942717f57e75904e.jpg><p>There’s no&nbsp;doubt about the fact that Cruise made a&nbsp;name for himself in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> after the release of&nbsp;<i>Top Gun</i>. Back then he&nbsp;had only been in&nbsp;the industry for four years but was already known for appearing in&nbsp;1983’s <i>Risky Business. </i>Top Gun, however, guaranteed his rise to&nbsp;worldwide fame.</p><p>Since then, and at&nbsp;59&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age, Cruise has appeared in&nbsp;more than 40&nbsp;films and is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;three more: two new installments of&nbsp;his successful <i>Mission: Impossible</i> saga and, of&nbsp;course, the long-awaited sequel to&nbsp;<i>Top Gun</i>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Top Gun: Maverick</i></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c73/bb3/0f864a5bc18e15cbeb84839236.jpg><p><h2>2. Nick “Goose” Bradshaw&nbsp;— Anthony Edwards</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54e/bff/6ab9145c3c90da39f1ba5a1ec7.jpg><p>After playing Maverick’s best friend in&nbsp;<i>Top Gun</i>, Anthony Edwards continued his acting career without much success. His filmography includes the 2007 film <i>Zodiac</i>, where he&nbsp;played Inspector William Armstrong. In&nbsp;2013, he&nbsp;lent his voice to&nbsp;the character Echo for the animated film <i>Planes</i>.</p><p>Edwards, 59, has also confirmed he’ll appear in&nbsp;Top Gun’s sequel. It’ll be&nbsp;the first time we’ll see him since 2015, when he&nbsp;landed a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Consumed</i></a>.</p><p><h2>3. Charlotte “Charlie” Blackwood&nbsp;— Kelly McGillis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa0/5f7/6880b65cf8b938352bf5104dbc.jpg><p>She was Maverick’s girl, but you’ll hardly hear from her after <i>Top Gun</i>. McGillis had only one other prominent role in&nbsp;the 1988 film <i>The Accused</i>. Then, in&nbsp;the next decades, she appeared in&nbsp;only five films, the most recent being 2011’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Innkeepers</i></a>.</p><p>Since 2013, Kelly has been an&nbsp;acting teacher at&nbsp;the New York Studio for Stage and Screen NYS3 in&nbsp;North Carolina.</p><p><h2>4. Tom “Iceman” Kazansky&nbsp;— Val Kilmer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/082/5c5/86f36e5fbeb5b170b8c0f0c086.jpg><p>Being Maverick’s rival was key to&nbsp;Val Kilmer becoming the respected performer he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today. Jim Morrison, Batman, Mark Twain and Elvis Presley are some of&nbsp;the names of&nbsp;the characters Kilmer has played in&nbsp;his long career.</p><p>In&nbsp;recent years, Kilmer’s projects became somewhat smaller. He&nbsp;often released them directly in&nbsp;home formats, but in&nbsp;2021&nbsp;he did appear <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Birthday Cake</i></a> with Ewan McGregor, and has also confirmed he’ll come back as&nbsp;Iceman for <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i>.</p><p><h2>5. Mike “Viper” Metcalf&nbsp;— Tom Skerritt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ee/118/443c9256669a4fa60e4b4a606e.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was no&nbsp;coincidence that the production of&nbsp;<i>Top Gun</i> chose Skerritt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the Viper commander, because of&nbsp;all the cast, he&nbsp;was the only one who was actually part of&nbsp;the U.S. Air Force during his youth in&nbsp;the 1950s. Skerrit is&nbsp;also one of&nbsp;the actors from this list that has the longest filmography.</p><p>He&nbsp;began his acting career in&nbsp;1962 in&nbsp;the film <i>War Hunt</i>, and in&nbsp;2021, at&nbsp;88&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age, he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;the films <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>East of&nbsp;the Mountains</i></a> and <i>Catch the Bullet</i>. Among his almost 70&nbsp;films, his appearances in&nbsp;<i>Alien</i>, <i>Ted</i>, <i>Dead Zone</i> and, of&nbsp;course, <i>Top Gun</i> stand out.</p><p><h2>6. Carol Bradshaw&nbsp;— Meg Ryan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54b/7bf/0712eb5416a98d1e1cb5260c18.jpg><p>Goose’s wife was played by&nbsp;Meg Ryan, who, during the 90s and early 2000s, became one of&nbsp;the best paid actresses in&nbsp;Hollywood. Roles in&nbsp;productions such as&nbsp;<i>When Harry Met Sally</i>, <i>You’ve Got an&nbsp;E-mail</i> and the biopic of&nbsp;the band <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Doors</a>, in&nbsp;which she again shared the stage with Val Kilmer, brought her to&nbsp;stardom.</p><p>By&nbsp;2016, Ryan made her directorial debut in&nbsp;the film <i>Ithaca</i>, where she also appeared for the last time. In&nbsp;2019, Ryan revealed that she was no&nbsp;longer interested in&nbsp;acting and ended her acting career.</p><p><h2>7. Rick “Jester” Heatherly&nbsp;— Michael Ironside</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/061/1f2/30deeb5ba9a69489c4bdf99901.jpg><p>Frederick Reginald Ironside, better known as&nbsp;Michael Ironside, played the flight instructor that Maverick and Goose defeat in&nbsp;their first training jump at&nbsp;the naval school known as&nbsp;Top Gun. Although his character is&nbsp;not that popular, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;Ironside’s long filmography.</p><p><i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Invasion</i>, <i>The Machinist</i> and <i>X-Men: First Generatio</i>n are some of&nbsp;his most popular films. His most recent screen appearance was in&nbsp;the acclaimed series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Dropout</i></a> in&nbsp;2021.</p><p><h2>8. Bill “Cougar” Cortell&nbsp;— John Stockwell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/967/483/da785a559fbc1a576e6dc4d7ba.jpg><p>Cougar appears in&nbsp;the first minutes of&nbsp;the film, only to&nbsp;disappear after a&nbsp;nervous breakdown in&nbsp;flight, which led him to&nbsp;retire and devote himself entirely to&nbsp;his family. The actor playing the character, John Stockwell, is&nbsp;still an&nbsp;active member of&nbsp;the film industry, but not as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor.</p><p>Since 2001, Stockwell has worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;director and writer for several films such as&nbsp;<i>Rockstar</i>,<i> Into The Blu</i>e and <i>The Hunted</i>. His most recent project was the 2017 film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Armed Response</i></a><i>,</i> starring Wesley Snipes.</p><p><h2>9. Sam “Merlin” Wells&nbsp;— Tim Robbins</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40c/c37/5b291659808c1d2329dd5c158c.jpg><p>The radar officer, who replaces Goose as&nbsp;Maverick’s partner in&nbsp;the last act of&nbsp;the film, went a&nbsp;little unnoticed, but the actor, Tim Robbins, has become a&nbsp;very important figure in&nbsp;the Hollywood industry.</p><p>Robbins played Andy Dufresne in&nbsp;the acclaimed 1994 film <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>. Ten years later, he&nbsp;would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in&nbsp;<i>Mystic River</i>. Robbins has also worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;director in&nbsp;several films, such as&nbsp;Bob Roberts and<i> I&nbsp;Still Believe</i>; the latter earned him a&nbsp;nomination for Best Director at&nbsp;the 1996 Academy Awards. His most recent project was 2019 series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Castle Rock</i></a>.</p><p><h2>10. Ron “Slider” Kerner&nbsp;— Rick Rossovich</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/206/67b/f590285c92a2392d2c54713b5b.jpg><p>Iceman’s radar intercept officer was played by&nbsp;Rick Rossovich, who stopped acting in&nbsp;the early 2000s. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;brief comeback in&nbsp;2012 with the independent film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sandbar</i></a>, but to&nbsp;this day, he&nbsp;continues as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stay-at-home dad in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p><h2>11. Leonard “Wolfman” Wolfe&nbsp;— Barry Tubb</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07b/e5b/7a0fb0574ca637adcba1c4d00d.jpg><p>The actor, who plays a&nbsp;radar intercept officer during the last mission, had a&nbsp;broad but not very popular career in&nbsp;Hollywood. After <i>Top Gun</i>, Barry Tubb appeared in&nbsp;some&nbsp;TV series, and in&nbsp;1997, he&nbsp;debuted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;director and screenwriter in&nbsp;the film <i>It&nbsp;Stains the Sand Red</i>.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Deliverance Creek</i></a> in&nbsp;2014 was the last film in&nbsp;which Tubb participated as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor; since then, “Wolfman” has been away from the spotlight.</p><p><h2>12. Tom “Stinger” Jordan&nbsp;— James Tolkan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/35e/507/cd259a5660abc633eb499bc1c6.jpg><p>Stinger is&nbsp;the one who sends Maverick and Goose to&nbsp;Top Gun. Tolkan is&nbsp;also well remembered for being director Geral Strickland in&nbsp;the <i>Back to&nbsp;the Future</i> saga. <i>Love and Death</i> from 1975 and <i>Dick Tracy</i> from 1990 are some of&nbsp;his other most memorable roles.</p><p>In&nbsp;his 90s, James continues to&nbsp;work, and in&nbsp;2021, he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;special program dedicated to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Back to&nbsp;the Future</i></a>.</p><p><h2>13. Marcus “Sundown” Williams&nbsp;— Clarence Gilyard&nbsp;Jr.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/624/656/8c7053503a9fada6c12fd5e79e.jpg><p>After loosing Goose, Sundown becomes Maverick’s radar intercept officer, but the latter is&nbsp;still too distraught to&nbsp;continue flying. Gilyard’s participation in&nbsp;this film was brief, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was his Hollywood debut, but with time, new opportunities would come for the rookie.</p><p>That same year he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;<i>Karate Kid: Part II,</i> <i>Die Hard</i> and the first two installments of&nbsp;<i>Forgotten</i> were some of&nbsp;his most outstanding roles. Gilyard appeared in&nbsp;some&nbsp;TV series and films, the most recent being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Christmas on&nbsp;the Coast</i></a> in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>How old were you when this film was released? And how have the actors changed during these years, according to&nbsp;you? Share your opinion in&nbsp;the comments.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent poll conducted by&nbsp;Showcase Cinemas, Tom Cruise was voted “<a href=#>the most attractive actor of&nbsp;all time</a>” by&nbsp;2,000 mothers worldwide in&nbsp;2022. This accolade comes as&nbsp;Cruise’s charm is&nbsp;once again highlighted in&nbsp;the “Top Gun” sequel. The actor, now&nbsp;60, continues to&nbsp;captivate audiences, proving that his appeal remains timeless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmq6GdXZi1or7AnKueqqNis7O7zGarqKhdnMKvecuopqRlnJ64pnmSb2SynZGnwG6txa2cq2Wknba0eZdpqmagmal6uK3SZqmepJWWwKawjHFncGxibHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-celebs-who-successfully-hide-their-pregnancies-with-super-cool-wardrobes-809554.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Celebs Who Successfully Hide Their Pregnancies With Super Cool Wardrobes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./assets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Visit Wales</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
