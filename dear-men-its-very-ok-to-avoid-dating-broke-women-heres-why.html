If the guy in question has a poor, retrogressive, closed mind, it just makes the curving a lot easier to do.</p><p>Everyone has priorities and relationship needs and I can understand the refusal to not date a guy with whom a relationship is going to be made unnecessarily difficult because of money issues.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Although that is not to say all 'broke' guys should be curved though. Just as it’s fine to curve guys because they are broke, it’s also fine to be with a broke guy if you trust his ambitions and feel comfortable with his abilities to move past that state in the not-so-distant future.</p><p>Any broke, stingy guy who also somehow has a work ethic and mindset of poverty should not feel bad for being curved.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-817aa0f6-4bb0-48e5-bc02-e6ef4c3ca8ad data-caption="Women, it's OK to not date women who are way below your financial standards [Credit - Shutterstock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/wzbktkqTURBXy8wOWRjOTA1NDNjM2VjZTE5YzljYTc4MGIwNzAwNWY3NC5qcGVnkZUCzQIzzQHrwsM></span><p>And so shouldn’t broke women, no matter how beautiful, light-skinned or thick they are.</p><p>Now this is where I feel the problem lies - women aren’t so comfortable with hearing this kind of truth. But it has to be said that just as women have the freewill to decide that a guy is broke and unfit to be in a relationship with them, guys have that same freewill, too.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And not only do they have the freewill to think like that, they have all the freedom to express that thought.</p><p>Just take for instance this interesting tweet from 2017, with which a user says he does not want to date a woman who does not earn up to 200K monthly and gets quite roasted by [not surprisingly] women.</p><p>For too long, quite a lot of women have gotten just by having attractive bodies, fine faces and nothing more.</p><p>So it seems that the reality of millennials actively seeking hardworking women, and actually placing a well-stated financial standard on them isn’t particularly sitting well with some.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a8b36d30-e56a-4377-b3b2-978fa33442ee data-caption="More young people in our generation want financially balanced relationships, where one person does not have to bear the burdens of the other.

It’s absolutely OK if a woman chooses to focus solely on slaying and glowing her pretty face with nothing else going for her. There's actually still a market for dependent women.</p><p>“…there are still men that love trophy wives and stay-at-home mums but they are petering out and becoming rarer with each Saturday that passes.</p><p>"Times have changed and… far gone are the days when more men didn’t mind having women totally dependent on them.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The modern man appreciates a woman who has something going for her.
