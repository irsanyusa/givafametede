This decision was caused by&nbsp;the following situation: his wife told him that since he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;biological father of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=children data-link=tag>children</a> (from the first marriage), he&nbsp;doesn’t get a&nbsp;say in&nbsp;any punishment even if&nbsp;they did something bad. Here is&nbsp;the <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a> told by&nbsp;himself.</p><p><h2>The man’s story</h2></p><p>My&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I have been married for about 4&nbsp;years. She brought 3&nbsp;kids from previous relationships into the marriage while&nbsp;I have none. They moved into my&nbsp;house after the marriage because&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;better <a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> district. Obviously we’ve had our ups and downs but overall it’s been good until a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks ago...</p><p>I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;and found a&nbsp;large dent running down the entire passenger side of&nbsp;my&nbsp;car. The dent is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;hand wide, starts at&nbsp;the front fender, and runs down all the way to&nbsp;the rear tire. I&nbsp;was furious and thought someone side swept my&nbsp;car as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was parked on&nbsp;the street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e14/188/43f71c5f649997bd8bef90e588.jpg><p>I&nbsp;checked our doorbell camera to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;it&nbsp;recorded anything and was surprised to&nbsp;see our 16-year-old daughter sneaking out of&nbsp;the house in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night and driving off in&nbsp;my&nbsp;car. She later returned hours later stumbling into the house. Outside those 2&nbsp;events, the doorbell camera didn’t record anything else but a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;passing cars that didn’t come close to&nbsp;mine.</p><p>I&nbsp;angrily showed my&nbsp;wife the recording and told her our daughter needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;punished, but she said that she would talk to&nbsp;her. I&nbsp;argued that talk isn’t enough which led&nbsp;us into an&nbsp;argument. My&nbsp;wife argued that the new family dynamic has been hard on&nbsp;the kids while&nbsp;I argued that it&nbsp;doesn’t excuse the damage done to&nbsp;my&nbsp;car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb1/cc9/36f3db512f83854a688f40c3c1.jpg><p>I&nbsp;wanted her to&nbsp;agree to&nbsp;ground our daughter from <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> and make her get a&nbsp;<a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> to&nbsp;pay for the damage. We&nbsp;argued for hours until <strong>she said&nbsp;I don’t get a&nbsp;say in&nbsp;any punishment because I’m not her father. </strong>That ended the argument, and&nbsp;I walked off. Since then, I’ve checked out of&nbsp;any parental duties. I’ve been an&nbsp;adult and still make sure the kids are safe and fed, but&nbsp;I haven’t done anything a&nbsp;father would&nbsp;do.</p><p>They had doctor’s appointments last week for their checkups because they play sports in&nbsp;school and&nbsp;I refused to&nbsp;drive them causing my&nbsp;wife to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take off work. They start school next week, and I’ve dropped them off ever since they moved&nbsp;in, but&nbsp;I told my&nbsp;wife she’ll have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;this year. She argued she can’t because of&nbsp;her work schedule, and&nbsp;I answered a&nbsp;mother would figure it&nbsp;out. She called me&nbsp;a&nbsp;child and to&nbsp;grow&nbsp;up.</p><p>I&nbsp;think since I’m not the father, I&nbsp;don’t have to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the responsibilities of&nbsp;one, but obviously she disagrees. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;in&nbsp;the wrong here?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cf/198/e94c7d5f60a888555d9c27ae4b.jpg><p><h2>Update</h2></p><p>I’m not ignoring the kids and&nbsp;I still talk to&nbsp;them daily. I&nbsp;just don’t do&nbsp;or&nbsp;make any parental decisions like&nbsp;I stated above. Also, the other day our son asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;should play <a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a> or&nbsp;<a href=# title=football data-link=tag>football</a> and&nbsp;I told him to&nbsp;go&nbsp;ask his mother.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;RealisticPirate5663&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></p><p><h2>Internet users’ comments</h2></p><ul><li>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;major red flag on&nbsp;the wife’s part.

You literally have camera evidence of&nbsp;her stealing your car and bringing it&nbsp;back damaged. If&nbsp;you’re “not allowed” to&nbsp;parent her, then treat her just like any other adult who has had their property stolen and call the cops.<br>It’s time to&nbsp;leave your wife. If&nbsp;you aren’t allowed to&nbsp;participate as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, none of&nbsp;them have any respect for you, and it&nbsp;will only get worse as&nbsp;time goes&nbsp;by.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Personal-Tourist3064&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>These are all really great points.
