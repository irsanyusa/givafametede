Embedded in the fundamental movie plot is the idea that <strong>Carroll Shelby </strong>was working on a <strong>Ford Mustang </strong>that could have been the greatest endurance race car with <strong>Ford Motor Company </strong>at the time he died.</p><p>While <strong>Shelby </strong>and his company <strong>Shelby American </strong>had built some amazing cars, the one he was building when he died would have been his crown jewel. That inconclusive end to that arc deprives <strong>Shelby </strong>and the American automotive industry of a momentous work of art that could have re-imagined the idea endurance race cars. That inconclusive end is pretty significant to the story of another human being across the Atlantic. His name is <strong>DaGrin.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>DaGrin</h2></p><p><strong>Carroll Shelby </strong>died on May 10, 2012. But on April 22, 2010, Nigerian rapper, <strong>DaGrin, </strong>a budding superstar with a head for rhymes and a skill for deft punchlines passed away after succumbing to injuries sustained in a car accident - nonetheless.</p><p>When the car was fictionally re-imagined in the movie, <strong>Need For Speed, </strong>it was a one-of-a-kind, beautifully built sports car with a muscle peculiar to <strong>Ford Mustangs. </strong>It bore a conspicuous silver painting with blue lining, had the gruffness to excel in dirt and importantly, it travels at a top speed of 234 miles per hour. The car was then sold for a whopping $2.7 million.</p><p><strong>DaGrin</strong>'s story is like the unfinished version of that car. Born <strong>Oladapo Olaitan Olaonipekun </strong>on October 25, 1984, <strong>DaGrin </strong>excelled because he represented the voice of the Nigerian people. Except you are counting the underground song, 'Democracy' and the off political reference in his music, being the voice of the people was not about being politically-driven for him.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Instead, he spoke for the polity and documented the struggles of inner-city Nigeria with a detail everyone could relate to. Even when you didn't understand what he was saying, you could tell that he was saying something special. Nigerian Journalist and Creative and Design Lead at <strong>MAVIN Records, Segun Akande </strong>agrees.</p><p>He says, "It was a feeling of knowing that there was someone who could channel the soul or the spirit of the streets - like the place I was embedded in - because of where I grew up. He talked about things I knew, but he did it with a kind of class, precision... Everything he had was amazing producer in <strong>Sossick </strong>- who is one of the greats."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b578fd86-f3da-4766-951e-afe1e3563aaf data-caption="On every verse, Dagrin was like an experienced wielding a colt pistol.

His natural 'street looks' was a brand and image that organically sold itself. Nigerian rapper, <strong>Paybac </strong>says, "<strong>Dagrin </strong>proved that there should not be a box. His flows and mannerisms were American as f**k. His content was very Nigerian and it worked.</p><p>"To me, he just showed that there's always a way to do it if you're passionate enough. The first time I listened to him, I think I felt awe. He reminded me of 2004 50 Cent and 2008 Lil Wayne - the swag and the delivery."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Asides that, he was the rapper's rapper and that endeared him towards the Nigerian Hip-Hop community that endorsed him without second thoughts. Between 2008 and 2010, he fed the beast of Nigerian Hip-Hop, impregnated it, watched it bear fruit, watch the fruit attain infancy and then passed on.</p><p>His emergence also coincided with the golden era of Nigerian Hip-Hop (2006-2010). <strong>Ayomide Tayo, Senior Editor </strong>at <strong>Opera News </strong>felt <strong>DaGrin </strong>marked the golden era of Nigerian Hip-Hop because he shifted culture.</p><p>His album, <strong>C.E.O </strong>(short for <strong>Chief Executive Omo-Ita </strong>or in English, Chief Executive Street Boy) sold out like colored ice water laced with sugar at 2pm in an inner-city Lagos primary school in the 90's. 'Pon Pon' became arguably the most-remixed Nigerian song of all-time. Across Nigerian radio stations and car sound systems, 'Pon Pon,' a core Hip-Hop track blared with intensity.</p><p>In fact, that beat birthed a lot of rap stars across Nigerian universities. Nigerian rapper, <strong>Mz Kiss </strong>told <strong>City FM </strong>in 2019 that she was a regular artist until she heard <strong>DaGrin. </strong>Of course, when you see <strong>Mz Kiss </strong>on a good day, she's an eloquent 'prom queen.' The street voice is all part of an act she sells and that's all down to <strong>DaGrin.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On inspiration, it was a mutual thing between <strong>DaGrin </strong>and Nigerian rapper/<strong>100 Crowns </strong>Exec, <strong>AQ </strong>who tells <strong>Pulse Nigeria </strong>that, "I was not close to Dagrin, I was not close to Sossick either till much later. We (Sossick and I) even had a rap battle back then, of course you know what the result was (laughs). Sossick and his brother Gino had started MOB records, I had recently finished my marketing my first project <strong>Listen and Overstand</strong> and distributed 5000 copies hand to hand - It took me close to a year.</p><p>"We put up posters everywhere we could. I wanted to collaborate (with <strong>DaGrin</strong>) - MSpeech was close to Sossick, so I asked him to help me talk to Sossick to set it up. Sossick told me Dagrin came to his crib to listen to beats and he saw my posters in the studio and said I was one of the guys that inspired him to push through.</p><p>"If I could cut CD's and push myself to sell them, then he could do it too. When I heard that, I was super inspired and did not request for a feature anymore, I just felt I could do it too."</p><p>During his chat with <strong>Pulse, </strong>Lagos-bred Lebanese rapper, <strong>Oyibo Rebel </strong>credits <strong>DaGrin </strong>with his style and gritty flows. He claims that his catchy tune, 'Ojumi Bloody' is highly inspired by <strong>DaGrin.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-25>DaGrin's death</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a6b88b0e-5787-4864-802c-748a89df9da9 data-caption="Dagrin sitting on his Nissam Maxima"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/-GyktkqTURBXy9jZGZlNDM2NjliZDMzNjczYzk1ODRjYTMxZmJkODYzMi5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQGfwsM></span><p><strong>DaGrin</strong> died at 25. Really, he died and it shocked the world. For a lot of Nigerians, that experience was different. I got the news in a Newspaper I went to buy that morning - soon after, my phone blew up with calls from friends and fellow music lovers who wanted to know if I'd heard the news.</p><p>On April 14, 2010, <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s Nissan Maxima rammed into a stationary truck at night. Some reports claim <strong>DaGrin</strong> was drunk, but those reports remain unproven. He went into a coma as a result of the collision.There were conflicting reports about his injuries. Some said he was okay and recovering. Others said he was in a pretty bad shape and his life was in the balance.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Capturing those events as a young journalist working for <strong>Hip-Hop World Magazine </strong>in 2010, former Senior Editor of <strong>Pulse Nigeria, </strong><a href=# id=8b327f71-f27a-44c1-a648-6056c07cd200>Ayomide Tayo writes</a>, "We got to LUTH and it was pretty much obvious something was going down.

A few minutes later stars started rolling in. <strong>Sasha</strong> was one of the first to show up. She looked sad. <strong>Olu Maintain</strong> in his immaculate blue jalabia and dark as hell sunshades managed to look ruffled.</p><p>"If you had any doubts that Dagrin was dead, <strong>YQ</strong> erased those doubts. He ran into LUTH like a man looking for hope. People who were with Dagrin at the time of his death confirmed to him that he was dead. YQ lost it. He rolled on the floor and wailed. Olu Maintain shrunk in size as he sadly shook his head. Dagrin was gone forever."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After <strong>DaGrin </strong>died, Nigerian music shrunk into one unit away from the competition. Even rivals momentarily forgot rivalry and focused on humanity - he was 25 and destined for greatness. He is like that car <strong>Carroll Shelby </strong>never got to finish. In his element, <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s entire run was actually the early stages of a greatness. It was a career in en embryonic stage - not fully formed.</p><p>When he passed, we had only started to see signs of the greatness - that was not even remotely close to his peak. It just so happens that the embryonic success of <strong>DaGrin </strong>is the peak for other artists. Asides that, his embryonic run was immense enough to warrant arguments for greatness. Like the unfinished car <strong>Carroll Shelby </strong>was working on when he died, the world never got to see the best of <strong>DaGrin.</strong></p><p><strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>opines that, "When DaGrin came out with 'Pon Pon' and C.E.O, people knew it was a gamechanger. Together with 'Kondo' and the remix, DaGrin was crossing over into the mainstream proper in the South-West especially when he passed away - it's just sad."</p><p>The arguments for DaGrin's greatness are also partly induced by the incidence of <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s death in his prime. As <strong>MAVIN Records Creative Lead, Segun Akande </strong>always says, "Death is a ready-made canvas for immortality. All you leave behind got no fault. Die young, live forever..." Nonetheless, only those destined for greatness will have arguments of greatness made for them after they die young.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The best we can do now though is build a dreamy song like 'Jonylah Forever' by <strong>Lupe Fiasco </strong>and dream of <strong>DaGrin </strong>living it out as a legend in a parallel universe. He was set to rule.</p><p>At his best, <strong>DaGrin </strong>would have been like a rare <strong>Carroll Shelby</strong>-$2.7 million <strong>Ford Mustang </strong>cruising and excelling effortlessly through the many punishing terrains of <strong>Le Mans </strong>while mocking the competition for being inadequate. He might even have evolved into something bigger and left a legacy bigger than anything we imagine.</p><p>But unlike <strong>Carroll Shelby, DaGrin</strong>'s legacy is now constantly bedraggled by petty arguments around his greatness, remembered with momentary big ups from his peers and pressure on the shoulders of his brother, <strong>Trod </strong>- also a rapper. It doesn't help that <strong>Trod </strong>went from being an <strong>Olamide </strong>fan to telling <strong>Naijaloaded TV </strong>that he would be bigger than <strong>Olamide </strong>in two years.</p><p>We have gotten the tribute songs, we have gotten the lazy conspiracy theories about <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s death from hungry liars, we have heard the posthumous rap verses<strong>, </strong>the eerily prophetic 'If I Die' and we have seen the <strong>Headies </strong>award. You might not believe it, but there is a legacy and a root.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-45>The arguments for greatness are not without reason though</h2></p><p>Most people knew <strong>DaGrin </strong>when he dropped that monster verse on <strong>YQ</strong>'s 2008 trap song, 'Efimile.' Nigerian rapper, <strong>Paybac, TeckZilla (also a producer) </strong>admit that the first time they heard <strong>DaGrin </strong>was on that song. But before then, <strong>DaGrin </strong>had a life and even an album released in 2006 titled, <strong>Still On The Matter.</strong></p><p>The album spurned popular songs like, 'If I Die,' 'Rap Rules Anthem,' 'E Soro' and 'Nii 94.' Unlike a lot of people, <strong>Segun Akande </strong>discovered <strong>DaGrin </strong>on 'Nii 94.' He says, "This was after I got into University in 2008. He was rhyming with '4' like, 'Buki to ma n wo Pina4 Nii 94, gbogbo yen o, itan ma niyen o..' His cadence and flow were on point, even though the beat wasn't A1. I was like 'who is this guy?'</p><p>"I wasn't sold right away because he wasn't everywhere, but I'd expected to hear of him later. When <strong>C.E.O </strong>dropped, I was so excited that I held a listening party for it in my parents' living room by inviting all my friends. We were vibing with my Mom until we got to 'Kondo' and when she yanked the CD out of the player. (laughs)"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-50>Terry Tha Rapman</h2></p><p><strong>Terry Tha Rapman </strong>says, "The first time I heard of DaGrin was about 2008. I was in Ikeja, Lagos at the time and word was around the streets about this Yoruba rapper who was really dope and gaining a lot of recognition.</p><p>"The second time was when he got on DJ Jimmy Jatt's Jump Off which got him a lot of attention and street cred. Then a few colleagues I worked with kept telling me about him (YQ, Laylow) but we never met.</p><p>"We first met on the set of 'Owo Ati Swagger (remix)' video set for Cartiair in 2009. I was the last to come on set because I had just flown in from Abuja and straight to location. He actually came at met me with a bottle of Hennessy which he told me he saved just for me. He got my love and respect that night. That was the kinda guy he was, cool and humble to my astonishment."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-55>Sossick</h2></p><p><strong>Sossick </strong>is now a veteran who mostly started out as a rapper. He is regarded as one of the greatest Nigerian Hip-Hop producers of all-time. His other brother is <strong>Owen Gee, </strong>but in 2006 while attending <strong>YabaTech,</strong> he became known for producing his other brother, <strong>Gino</strong>'s critically-acclaimed album, <strong>Pain Plus Work. </strong>Famously, he produced a chunk of <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s classic debut, <strong>C.E.O.</strong></p><p>Also famously, <strong>DaGrin </strong>hailed <strong>Sossick </strong>on 'Pon Pon' intro, "Sossick on the beat, 70 beats in a week..." On how he met <strong>DaGrin, Sossick </strong>told <strong>Loose Talk Podcast </strong>in 2017 that, "We had just finished recording 'Pain Plus Work' when <strong>Gino </strong>came into the studio said there was this guy called 'Grin... something' He said the guy raps in Yoruba and he had seen one of his videos."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Gino </strong>had heard 'RapRules Anthem' off <strong>Still On The Matter </strong>and he was raving to his brother, <strong>Sossick </strong>in 2006. <strong>Sossick </strong>never heard the song or watched the video and he moved on with life. Then, one day in 2007 <strong>Sossick </strong>got a call from <strong>DaGrin. </strong>Immediately, it rang a bell in his head that it was the guy his brother was raving about months earlier. They agreed to see.</p><p><strong>DaGrin </strong>went to see <strong>Sossick </strong>at YabaTech with <strong>Sati Ramoni. </strong>On that moment, <strong>Sossick </strong>says, "The way he believe in me ehn, nobody in this life has ever believed in me like that. So he said, "Boss, we gats work o...'" The plan was to work on one or two songs, but it became an entire working relationship and a brotherhood.</p><p>The first beat <strong>Sossick </strong>gave <strong>DaGrin </strong>was meant for <strong>Banky W. </strong>That beat became 'Gboro.' From there, <strong>Sossick </strong>who was blown away by <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s prowess requested they work on more songs and so it began.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-64>AQ</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>AQ </strong>is now one of the greatest Nigerian rappers to have ever picked up a microphone. He has worked his way from the underground into the sub-mainstream. In the days that <strong>Sossick </strong>met <strong>DaGrin, AQ </strong>used to record at another rapper named <strong>MSpeech's </strong>(on Twitter as @<strong>AceAkes</strong>) studio. <strong>MSpeech </strong>was close to <strong>Sossick </strong>and through that connection, <strong>AQ </strong>met <strong>DaGrin </strong>for the first time.</p><p><strong>MSpeech </strong>and <strong>AQ </strong>had both just left a record label at the time. <strong>AQ</strong> says, "We had both just left a record label that did nothing for us and he decided to set up a home studio, He (MSpeech) introduced me to Sossick and a network of music makers around Ejigbo. I think <strong>DaGrin </strong>was a Gowon boy with <strong>DJ Neptune </strong>and <strong>YQ.</strong></p><p>"These guys Sossick, Laylow (now Kelvin BOJ) ,<strong> Frizzle </strong>of <strong>Frizzle </strong>and <strong>Bizzle </strong>who was a talented producer and singer then, <strong>Rayce, Sheyman, KP</strong> all lived in Ejigbo. They were some of the first people I knew to own home studios, Dagrin had started to buzz and had just started work with Sossick.</p><p>"Honestly, I was always around incredible talent back then. There were so many artistes rapping in Yoruba around that area. Dagrin had this 50 cent thing about the way he delivered. I think that's what stood him apart. There were a lot of us - we were all special, any of us could make it big but not all of us would eventually stick to music."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-70>Ayomide Tayo</h2></p><p>In 2009, <strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>met <strong>DaGrin </strong>and <strong>YQ. </strong>He interviewed them too, but the picture he took that day was saved because he cherished it. He didn't even realize that picture was going to be material. He says, "I wanted to interview them - I think - but after, I thought to take a picture with them because I wanted to mark the moment."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-73>2008/2009: DaGrin's confidence</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In 2008, <strong>DaGrin </strong>was blowing up. <strong>AQ </strong>attests to that period, "Dagrin was blowing up we could all feel it." That was the year he contributed his famous verse to <strong>YQ</strong>'s 'Efimile.' For me, that was when I heard of him. My friends came back from Lagos to then-University of Ado-Ekiti and would not shut up about this guy named, <strong>DaGrin </strong>who had just killed <strong>YQ</strong>'s trap song.</p><p>While speaking to <strong>Kraftmatiks </strong>for <strong>Modenine</strong>'s album, <strong>Da Vinci Mode, </strong>he told me a story about <strong>MI Abaga </strong>and <strong>DaGrin. Kraftmatiks </strong>produced the famous 'Fast Money, Fast Cars' featuring <strong>Wizkid </strong>from <strong>MI Abaga</strong>'s debut album, <strong>Talk About It. </strong>Asides that, he knew <strong>AQ, Sossick, MSpeech </strong>and the rest of the Ejigbo-Ikotun crew.</p><p>On how he made 'Fast Money, Fast Cars,' he says, "<strong>MI Abaga </strong>and I were at <strong>Bogobiri </strong>when we walked outside and I played him the beat for 'Fast Money, Fast Cars.'</p><p>"<strong>MI Abaga </strong>lost his mind and was overjoyed. Work began on the song immediately." As we spoke further, <strong>Kraftmatiks </strong>confirmed that <strong>MI Abaga </strong>also saw <strong>DaGrin </strong>coming. He says, "<strong>MI Abaga </strong>had commenced work on the song and guess who was meant to be featured alongside Wizkid? <strong>DaGrin </strong>(laughs).</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"When I gave the beat to <strong>DaGrin </strong>in <strong>Surulere, </strong>he was excited and kept saying, "I will kill this beat..." but somehow, the collaboration never happened for some reason." A lot of people will allude to <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s confidence in himself at the time just as he could easily get excited over anything.</p><p><strong>AQ </strong>agrees, "I did not know him in person, but artists wanted to always know what fellow artists were up to back then - especially if you knew someone in their camp. It was the only way to keep up with the game and not be left behind. Everyone was trying different things - there was no blue print.</p><p>"From what I heard about him, he just somehow knew he was going to be big; his confidence was on a different level and he went out there on his own and did it. We all used to ask, 'Who is behind this guy?' because back then everyone that was popping in rap had some label or sponsor behind them. He had none, sponsors started jumping on the train when he started blowing up."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>By 2009, he was a full-blown menace in Hip-Hop. <strong>TeckZilla </strong>says, "I could tell that <strong>DaGrin </strong>knew Hi-Hop. The way he rapped was steps ahead of other Yoruba emcees at that time. He definitely raised it when it came to rap."</p><p>He killed five minutes of the famous <strong>Jimmy's Jump Off</strong>, released his monstrous single, 'Pon Pon,' supported it with an amazing video and released his debut album, <strong>C.E.O.</strong></p><p>On this era, <strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>says, "I felt 'Pon Pon' was going to change everything. Nigerian rap never got the street constituency right, but DaGrin hacked it better than anybody else - he was basically writing biographies of people below the poverty song. I think Sossick and DaGrin formed an amazing producer-rapper duo. Some songs sound dated on the album, but it's a great album."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-89>Impact</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Ayomide Tayo</strong> says, "DaGrin is one of the most influential Nigerian rappers of all-time - someone who shifted culture for Nigerian rap music. The soundscape before DaGrin was ruled by pop music - especially by P Square, D'Banj, 2Face and 9ice. A year before DaGrin dropped 'C.E.O,' MI Abaga dropped 'Talk About It' and Naeto C dropped, 'You Know My P.'</p><p>"'Talk About It' changed Nigerian rap music forever. At that time, Nigerian rap went from super-lyrical to being flashy and lifestyle-driven. We had Nigerian versions of T.I. Kanye West and Lil Wayne - everybody could enjoy MI Abaga, Naeto C and DaGrin. At the time, you have to also realize that rap music influenced pop waves even at the time - Ruggedman, Swatroots, Eedris and Trybesmen."</p><p>In a country like Nigeria where Hip-Hop is not exactly a staple of mainstream pop music, Hip-Hop is best-consumed by its detractors in ways they wouldn't realize is the Hip-Hop they criticize. <strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>says, "I think DaGrin broke that stigma attached to rap music and made it easy for people."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-65ac8734-62ea-4c28-a35a-7ecd5aa5be7a data-caption="Dagrin (21 October 1987 – 22 April 2010)"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/oR-ktkqTURBXy81ZjZkMTllNjVhY2EzNDkwNDVmMmM3YTg3ZTMzMjU5MS5qcGVnkZUCzQEszQErwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the streets of Lagos and beyond, <strong>DaGrin </strong>was a cultural staple that built a link between Hip-Hop and the mainstream.

Kudos to his team - <strong>DaGrin </strong>stayed on the streets, but got to that mainstream level where he was banging in the clubs. It was like a TIDAL Wave."</p><p>In fact, at the height of <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s fame, he exemplified the oft-missing truth that Hip-Hop will only thrive in Nigerian mainstream when a large section of the polity can relate to it.</p><p>He exemplified what <strong>Paul Play Dairo </strong>told <strong>Ruggedman </strong>in the early 2000s about infusing the mother tongue, Nigerian cultural references and Nigerian ideals into Hip-Hop as the only way to succeed. (Ruggedman rapped about it on 'Ruggedy Baba' featuring <strong>9ice.</strong>)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>says, "Before DaGrin came, a lot of so-called 'Hip-Hop heads' never really accepted indigenous rappers - they felt rapping in your mother was some sort of gimmick. <strong>AY </strong>in London or <strong>Lord of Ajasa </strong>got buzz, but not credibility from the Hip-Hop community. About three years before <strong>DaGrin </strong>blew, <strong>Ruggedman </strong>and <strong>Modenine </strong>had a beef over this issue of mother tongue.</p><p>"But when DaGrin came, he brought realness, rawness and authenticity to indigineous rap music in Nigeria and had that respect and credibility."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-102>Legacy</h2></p><p><strong>Terry Tha Rapman </strong>says, "DaGrin was a major force in Naija Hiphop not just indigenous - he could rap in English and Yoruba effortlessly and he had a movement growing in the streets after the second album CEO dropped.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I was on two collaborations with him before the untimely end (Owo ati Swagger rmx & Meet me at the Top). His legacy still lives on till date and he will always be in Naija rap debates and topics."</p><p><strong>AQ </strong>says, "Dagrin is the most important figure in Nigerian Hiphop. He could rap in English and Yoruba, he would rap with any rapper whether you rapped in English or Yoruba and still stand out. I don't know if there is anything like 'English rap,' I believe we all just rap. <strong>M.I</strong> blew up, <strong>Ice Prnce </strong>blew up, <strong>Naeto C</strong> too, but Dagrin took blowing to a whole new level. That became what rappers aspired to and Olamide was able to rise to the occasion."</p><p>If <strong>Ruggedman </strong>was a forerunner of the ideal, <strong>DaGrin </strong>broke the door down and created a worthy blueprint that rappers like <strong>Olamide, Reminisce </strong>and to an extent, <strong>Phyno </strong>and <strong>Classiq </strong>could follow. While Nigeria had seen rappers like <strong>Lord of Ajasa, Nigga Raw </strong>and more rap in their mother tongue, <strong>DaGrin</strong>'s success was different.</p><p>He had the respect of the Hip-Hop community and the star power that could sell in the mainstream. He was the antithesis of English speaking rap in Nigeria and he made English speaking rappers contemplate their next moves. Speaking on how <strong>DaGrin </strong>influenced non-Yoruba speaking rapeprs, <strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>feels it was not as direct.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>However, he feels like <strong>DaGrin </strong>showed that language is not really a barrier. He says, "DaGrin proved that if your music is honest enough, you will sell. Today, Zlatan is doing shows in the core North, Olamide is doing shows in the East, Phyno is doing shows in the west.</p><p>"There's also something with language that DaGrin changed. It's like going to the market and you're speaking English with a Yoruba woman. If you switch to Yoruba, you'll find out that the connection is different. People who have their guard up against Hip-Hop will let their guards down when they hear Yoruba, Igbo or Hausa - it's emotional.</p><p>"A lot of people who listen to Olamide or Phyno won't listen to Jay Electronica - it's not their business, he's not telling their story. But once Badoo speaks in Yoruba or Phyno speaks Igbo, you give them a chance. Even if you're not from that tribe, you listen because you're a Nigerian and you can feel emotions. I don't understand what Phyno says, but I listen."</p><p>On what made <strong>DaGrin </strong>different, <strong>Segun Akande </strong>says, "It was around the time that <strong>Lord of Ajasa </strong>was blowing up as well, telling grimy stories and releasing hits. Lord of Ajasa felt like some guy who came off a bus-stop and went into the booth to vent all the trouble he'd experienced while <strong>Dagrin </strong>felt like some guy in the corner of his mom's room just taking everything in.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"But instead of going straight into the booth, he had a workman listening to 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Ludacris and early trap music. His experiences were not just filtered through momentary music, they were filtered through quality music worthy of respect and blueprint status. It felt like <strong>Dagrin </strong>knew he could make sense on that international level, but knew he lacked the resources. I just wanted him to get sponsors."</p><p>While <strong>Segun Akande </strong>was just a member of the audience at the time, this point ties into the confidence that <strong>Kraftmatiks </strong>and <strong>AQ </strong>had pointed to earlier.</p><p>While <strong>MI Abaga </strong>is the greatness that the golden age of Nigerian Hip-Hop (2006-2010) birthed, <strong>DaGrin </strong>was its crown jewel, its legacy and its greatest offering and lesson to the Nigerian Hip-Hop community. Asides that, <strong>DaGrin </strong>was a potential lifestyle movement who spoke the truth of the majority. His stories represented the bread and butter for the mainstream.</p><p>Again, <strong>Segun Akande </strong>comes through. He says, "I think before <strong>DaGrin, </strong>a lot of rappers felt a need to sell aspirations, but <strong>DaGrin </strong>simply validated the struggle when he came on. Even Lord of Ajasa that was talking the grimy stuff was pulling up in big whips and getting all the girls.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Every young person would aspire to that, but <strong>Dagrin </strong>was special because he was not focused on getting to the top of the ladder, he was focused on everybody at the bottom of that ladder to get to that top. He kicked the door open for a lot of people. The way I see it, I don't think there will be a <strong>Naira Marley </strong>without a <strong>DaGrin </strong>because there are certain perspectives that the mainstream shuts out.</p><p>"Dagrin opened the door to those perspectives.and packaged it in solid, grimy Hip-Hop and that was it. The opening words of his first verse of 'Pon Pon' was my reality, it's yours... He didn't force it and it was organically resonant. I remember when a friend used to look down on Dagrin and another of my friends said, "You nor know my story, you nor fit understand."</p><p>"It's like how people look down on mumble rappers now while kids who have been addicted to drugs all their lives due to personality or behavioural issues can relate more than they will to Jay Electronica."</p><p>To <strong>Paybac, DaGrin </strong>taught him that, "There shouldn't be a box." Veteran producer, <strong>TeckZilla </strong>says, "He had a good ear for beats and his songwriting was good. He could flow on boombap, afropop effortlessly. It should be that he opened broke down doors for Yoruba rap to really sink in. Only time will tell but as long as we pay respects his legacy should still be intact.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"He was able to fuse the grittiness of the streets with commercial appeal while keeping the Hip-Hop element in his delivery. Need I say more?! Rest in power."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-126>DaGrin paves the way</h2></p><p>In a previous article, this writer examined that, this writer wrote thus, "If <strong>DaGrin </strong>were alive, chances are he could have operated at the level <strong>Olamide </strong>is. Chances are also that he might not have. In 2010, Nigeria's hottest artist was <strong>Wande Coal. </strong>Fast forward 10 years later, <strong>Wizkid </strong>who is probably an offspring of his style is far greater than <strong>Wande Coal. </strong>Thus, nothing is ever set in stone.</p><p><strong>"Olamide </strong>could have eclipsed <strong>DaGrin </strong>and he could have ended up playing catch-up to <strong>DaGrin </strong>throughout his career - nobody knows.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"There is also a chance that could have both co-existed like <strong>Wizkid </strong>and <strong>Davido </strong>and thrived together. But one thing we shall not deny is that, <strong>DaGrin </strong>is <strong>Olamide</strong>'s forerunner. When <strong>DaGrin </strong>died, the listener-scape was better prepared to accept a Yoruba-speaking rapper as a superstar than it was when <strong>Ajasa </strong>was popping.</p><p><strong>"DaGrin </strong>crashed doors open in the soundscape with his endearing ability and technique. <strong>Lord of Ajasa </strong>was a momentous occurrence in Nigerian music, but <strong>DaGrin </strong>took it further than <strong>Ajasa </strong>ever did. Apologies to <strong>Burna Boy, </strong>but <strong>DaGrin</strong> paved the way for <strong>Olamide.</strong></p><p>"Yes, <strong>DaGrin </strong>did things for himself, but while doing things for himself, he became a trailblazer who inspired many and made an entire country more willing to celebrate a Yoruba-speaking rapper. At least, <strong>DaGrin </strong>took over from where <strong>Ajasa </strong>left off. That's not to say <strong>DaGrin </strong>didn't also benefit from time - he did.</p><p>"Everyone in the history has benefited from the element of timing for their greatness. Even <strong>Jay Z </strong>only really took off as a mainstream superstar after <strong>The Blueprint </strong>was released. You cannot undermine the influence of <strong>DaGrin </strong>in what <strong>Olamide </strong>has achieved and that's facts. That said, we need to be careful about arguments that could easily be defeated by time."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In those quotes, take <strong>Olamide </strong>to mean other indigenous rappers - especially the Yoruba-speaking ones. <strong>Akande </strong>buttresses with <strong>Hegel</strong>'s philosophy that, "His main postulation is that history is a thread of events, rather than random events just happening. If you look at history, you would see that things are connected cordially - outcomes and events are interlinked.</p><p>"If you look history as a thread, you begin go notice patterns. I feel nothing happens in isolation. Applying that to music, one pacesetter cannot exist without another pacesetter. I grew up in Ketu and I used to see Reminisce as a neighbourhood hero. I can't say Reminisce wouldn't have made it without Dagrin.</p><p>"However, I also understand that the doors Dagrin opened would have remained shut for Reminisce had Dagrin not opened them. It would have been more difficult for Reminisce. I'd never say that Dagrin paved the way for anybody, but he made it easier for people who came after him to pass through."</p><p>The question then becomes whether <strong>Dagrin </strong>opened any doors. On that, <strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>says, "I don't want to say DaGrin directly influenced anybody or that his death triggered the golden era of Hip-Hop. I remember that a few months after DaGrin died, a young Olamide came to audition for <strong>Ayo Animashaun </strong>to perform at the Headies nominees party.</p><p>"I was like 'who is this guy coming after DaGrin?' But what do I know. Look at Baddo now (laughs). I think DaGrin must have given the Yoruba rappers confidence or courage to go at it. Olamide did it, Reminisce switched to Yoruba and boom. Phyno from the East did it with four hardcore singles. I can't say Phyno listened to DaGrin, but you can't take certain things out of the equation."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In the end, <strong>Ayomide Tayo </strong>says, "<strong>DaGrin </strong>had a great moment, but it will be unfair to then elevate him over people like <strong>Olamide, Phyno </strong>and<strong> Reminisce </strong>who have done greater things. <strong>DaGrin </strong>could have been a great rapper, but it never happened."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-141>DaGrin Lives</h2></p><p>Today, a young rapper like <strong>Alaye Proof </strong>is still referencing <strong>DaGrin </strong>in his 2020 album. On the 'Intro' to his album, he raps, "Tupac is alive and DaGrin dey. Jesu won l'oku, Jesu wa ji l'ojo ajinde..." Thus means, "Tupace is alive and DaGrin is alive. Only their Jesus died, our Jesus rose on the resurrection."</p><p><strong>DaGrin </strong>isn't dead. <strong>DaGrin </strong>lives. His legacy is intact. 10 years after, the pulse of Nigerian music still resonates his impact.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2R%2BcXnYnpirq12Ws7Wx0Wabmp%2Binru0ecOemK2gXayybsDApaJmmZKkwrV5x6KqZqSZm7JutMisZJ2dkam1brTIrGSipaCWsLV5wKebZqCZqHyvvJSgnbCf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adaora-umeoji-zenith-bank-ceo-gmd.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adaora Umeoji Zenith Bank CEO, GMD</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-flatshare-book.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Flatshare: Best Romance Books</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./differences-swiss-german-and-german.html>4 differences between Swiss and Standard German</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./battle-in-heaven-1200525810.html>Battle In Heaven</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./headband-games-7-strange-nba-superstitions.html>Headband Games: 7 Strange NBA Superstitions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-circulaire-renovant-les-relations-entre-pouvoirs-publics-et-associations-est-parue.html>La circulaire rnovant les relations entre pouvoirs publics et associations est parue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./legend-and-groundbreaker-jo-koy-just-for-laughs-1234791083.html>Legend and Groundbreaker Jo Koy Goes from Open Mics to Stadiums and Specials</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
